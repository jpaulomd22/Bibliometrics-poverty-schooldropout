abstract={Background: The importance of educating female adolescents has been recognized as critical to the development of any country. However, in low income countries like Zambia they often drop out of school due to poverty, early pregnancy and early marriages. Some studies indicate that economic support such as Social Cash Transfers (SCTs) can mitigate the effects of poverty on female adolescents by improving their school participation and helping postpone pregnancy and marriage. This study aimed to explore the role of economic support in influencing education and sexual decision making among female adolescents in a randomised controlled trial in Zambia. Methods: The study adopted a qualitative approach. It utilized purposive and convenient sampling. Data were collected from 6 schools using 18 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) comprising 48 school-going female adolescents in grade 8 aged 14 to 17. All participants received economic support in form of SCTs and payment of school fees as part of the Research Initiative to Support the Empowerment of Girls (RISE), a Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Findings suggested several benefits of the economic support for the female adolescents such as economic independence and empowerment; increased assertiveness and autonomy; reduced desire for sexual relationships with boys in exchange for cash and gifts; increased motivation for school; enhanced parental and community support for female adolescents’ education and; reduced school dropouts. However, they also experienced jealousy from those who did not benefit from the economic support. Conclusion: Economic support played a significant role in influencing both educational and sexual decision making among female adolescents.

abstract={An early pregnancy often puts an end to a girls’ education. However, few studies have investigated which factors affect adolescents’ school discontinuation during pregnancy. This study interviewed 1,046 adolescent mothers from the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. The results showed that a quarter of school-going adolescent girls withdrew from school during the pregnancy - many as early as the first trimester. School withdrawal was associated with higher poverty, higher grade repetition, an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, and greater lack of information about the pregnancy. Given the high enrolment rates at the onset of the pregnancy, school-based services may provide an opportunity to identify which girls require substantial support to remain in education throughout pregnancy, using a history of poor school performance as an indicator for dropout. © 2021},

abstract={Background: Research on addiction recovery describes recovery as a process leading to cessation of drug use. Few researchers have explored alternative views of recovery, and the interplay of individuals' agency and social context in the recovery process. This study explored situated understandings of recovery among cannabis users that emphasized process and contingency. Methods: We conducted the study in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria. Participants were current (street-involved) cannabis users aged 21 to 34 (n = 97), recruited through time-location sampling. The study collected data through in-depth, individual interviews, which study staff transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Results: Participants' accounts indicated a quest for treatment as a means of recovery and redemption (i.e., repairing an identity damaged by dependent cannabis use). Relapse affected recovery when participants defined the latter as abstinence. Framing recovery this way showed the effects of social and structural factors on individual agency and treatment experiences. Yet some participants' accounts highlighted a redefinition of recovery as a process (“recovering”), measured by such outcomes as reduced drug use and improved overall well-being. Conclusions: Reframing recovery, as some participants' accounts in our study capture, speaks to the need for treatment programs that are informed by the principles of harm reduction and health promotion. Instead of foisting a singular treatment goal defined as total abstinence onto drug users seeking treatment, treatment should be attuned to the experiences and life circumstances of users and support them in achieving their recovery goals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The psychological well-being at school of immigrant students living in poverty is currently an understudied topic in developmental psychology. This is an important shortcoming because this population, which is rapidly increasing in many western countries, is in a double minority condition and has a greater risk of experiencing psychological distress at school, in comparison with their native peers. In order to improve our understanding on this issue, the present two-wave study investigated the prospective relationships between peer acceptance and two aspects of well-being at school—intention to drop out of school and negative self-esteem—specifically focusing on the differential effect of having (vs. not having) an immigrant background. The participants were 249 preadolescents and adolescents living in poverty (Mage = 12.76; SDage = 2.34; 41.8% girls; 19.3% immigrants) who were attending educational centres for disadvantaged minors. The poverty status of the participants was an inclusion criterion. A multilinear regression model with multigroup analysis was tested. As expected, the results showed that peer acceptance had a significant negative association with school dropout intentions and negative self-esteem only for immigrants, but not for natives. For immigrant students, the protective effect of peer acceptance was comparable to the stability over time of dropout intention and self-esteem, a result that has promising implications for prevention programs. The applied implications of the study for educational and clinical contexts are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: Adolescent parenthood is a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the vast majority of the evidence has focused on adolescent motherhood. Little is known about adolescent fatherhood in LMICs. The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of early fatherhood and its consequences on a range of outcomes among adolescent males. Methods: This study used three waves of longitudinal data from the multicountry Young Lives cohort study, specifically following a sample of 1,779 adolescent boys at ages 15, 19, and 22 years in Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam. Individual fixed effects models were conducted to investigate the sociodemographic determinants of adolescent fatherhood and the consequences of adolescent fatherhood on males' education, health, psychosocial well-being, and time use outcomes. Results: The results indicated that lower educational attainment, absence of the adolescent's mother and father from the home, larger household size, and poverty increased the likelihood of becoming an adolescent father by age 22 years. The results revealed that becoming an adolescent father was associated with a higher likelihood of school dropout, being overweight, smoking, greater internalizing problems, and less time spent on leisure activities and more time spent on caregiving responsibilities. Conclusions: Highlighting the experiences of young men as adolescent parents in LMICs, findings underscore the importance of prevention strategies to delay early parenthood for adolescent boys and multicomponent interventions to support young fathers and their unique health, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral needs. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine},

abstract={Labor exploitation is one of the phenomena that afflict humanity. Ecuadorian society is not exempt from this suffering. Children, adoles-cents, and pregnant women are the most affected by occupational risk factors. Among the most predominant causes are poverty, school dropouts and non-compliance with the regulations that govern work. The Ecuadorian State has legislated the process, although it should be noted that there are problems that prevent its eradication. This article is linked to children, adolescents, pregnancy, and work, providing concepts of both categories to determine the causes, effects and risk factors where regulatory and control entities lack effectiveness in suppressing exploitation in the workplace. To this end, not only has Ecuadorian legislation been consulted, but also the international trend has been assessed regarding the legal treatment and practical behavior of what is currently known as child labor and occupational risks in pregnancy. Among the methods used for data processing are the General Method of Problem Solving, the brainstorm technique, the field-force method, and the Ishikawa diagram. © 2021, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

abstract={The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) was initiated in India in 2006 with a view to creating more wage employment in rural areas thereby ameliorating rural poverty. With the right based framework and demand-driven approach, its initial target has been to guarantee at least 100 days of employment to adults of the rural households every year. But after the completion of more than a decade, the effects and roles of the scheme are found to be manifolds. Particularly, if we consider the impact of women participation under the scheme the results can be witnessed in varied fields. As the scheme has converted some of the unpaid hours of the women into paid hours it has started to change their role in the family. By putting cash in the hands of women MGNREGA has allowed them greater bargaining power in the family thereby diversifying the contributions that women have been making to households. There have been drastic changes in the family consumption pattern as well as family budgeting. While their contribution to the health account has augmented economic security, their role as a financier of the children for their education has led to substantial changes, even impacting the school dropout rate to some extent. All these issues have been taken care of in this chapter based on a micro-level survey done in the district of Nadia, West Bengal. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: YouthBuild programs are uniquely designed to address the status of unemployed and uneducated young men and women who are disconnected from work and education. This study, on YouthBuild Las Vegas (YBLV), aims to fill the call for more research on transformative service research, specifically related to education, poverty and well-being. The program educates “opportunity youth” in construction skills while also encouraging progression toward a GED/HiSet or high school diploma. Service providers can better understand how to increase and support reconnection and well-being, especially among low-income individuals in communities with great needs for support services. Design/methodology/approach: This yearlong qualitative research study intended to better understand transformative service within the context of former high school dropouts previously without a path to a productive future. YBLV was an ideal single-site case study because it was bound by space, people, organization and time. The study followed one YBLV class from admission through graduation; the qualitative work with the organization started prior to the students’ enrollment and continued after the students graduated. Primary data collections were interviews and observations. Additional data collection occurred in the forms of written documents, as well as photos and videos. Findings: YBLV succeeded because of service providers’ attention to the funds of knowledge of the student population and adapting the format and structure of programs to adult learners, developing mentors for consumers and acknowledging the context and layers of knowledge that consumers brought to the program. The students were able to experience reconnection and increased well-being because of the service providers’ impact throughout the program. Research limitations/implications: Transformative service research (TSR) research has focused on areas as diverse as health care and homelessness, whereas the lens of funds of knowledge has primarily been applied within educational settings. It would be worthwhile to apply funds of knowledge framework beyond education yet still within the TSR agenda. There are also opportunities to apply the theory to other vulnerable populations. Broadening the scope of reconnection and well-being TSR research far beyond YouthBuild may identify additional or other synergies between these areas. Practical implications: The growing body of research on TSR suggested a gap in understanding how service providers can support consumers in poverty and a need for greater well-being. This study on YouthBuild highlighted the phenomenon among low-income, undereducated, urban young adults and while the goal of qualitative research is not to be generalizable, specific examples such as adapting programs and structures to low-income consumers, developing mentors to model wanted behavior and goal-setting and acknowledging the funds of knowledge that consumers bring to situations, can be generic ingredients for future transformative service projects. Social implications: Research has demonstrated that public investment in programs that assist youth toward a positive trajectory and greater well-being is much more beneficial than disciplinary measures such as increased spending on policing and prisons. Employment and educational training programs have led to measurable success and when disconnected youth have greater vocational training and high school completion, they and the broader economy experience improved outcomes. Therefore, from a policy perspective, YouthBuild and programs like it emphasize growth, development and well-being for undereducated and low-income individuals. Originality/value: The funds of knowledge theoretical framework are new to the Journal of Services Marketing (JSM). That framework coupled with the population of former high school dropouts in a second-chance school and a focus on service providers and well-being within a poverty context, all contribute to the paper’s originality. Reconnection is also a relatively new concept for readers of JSM. These three areas: funds of knowledge, reconnection and TSR are the backbone of this research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

funding_text 1={YouthBuild Las Vegas is federally funded by a US Department of Labor grant and the program is dependent on these funds for surviving and thriving. Research has demonstrated that public investment in programs that assist youth toward a positive trajectory and greater well-being is much more beneficial than disciplinary measures such as increased spending on policing and prisons (; ). Employment and educational training programs have led to measurable success in preventing crime (; ). When juvenile offenders have greater vocational training and high school completion, they and the broader economy experience improved outcomes (). Therefore, from a societal and policy perspective, YouthBuild and programs like it that emphasize economic and personal growth, development and well-being for undereducated and low-income individuals should continue to be funded to benefit individuals and society. However, the past few years have seen the federal administration’s current budget proposals cutting or eliminating several education programs like YouthBuild. Opportunity youth can only thrive if funding is available to create those opportunities. Rather than cutting budgets for programs like YouthBuild, research clearly identifies a need for an influx of funding to increase consumers’ well-being and overcome barriers out of poverty, which in the long run will reduce the costs for prisons. Notably, with the case of YBLV, more individuals apply than can be enrolled each year – a missed opportunity for greater impact in the community. More consumers may benefit in terms of their own objective and subjective well-being, a conclusion that is most inspiring and deserving of policy support for the “uplifting changes” created by this transformative service (). Increased public investment is needed for transformative service and consumer well-being on a larger scale.},

abstract={Youths are an important segment in a community as they are seen as the future leaders of a nation. One cannot deny that at-risk youths grow in environments not conducive to their well-being. These youths are victims of families where there is neglect, violence, poverty, sexual abuse and many other conflicts. Due to poverty and family instability, these youths are more sensitive to social ills. Based on a positive youth development perspective, this study aimed to share some real stories narratively from several identified at-risk youths via in-depth interviews conducted individually. The informants were selected by using purposive sampling taking into consideration their background and variables related to socio-economic status, dropout numbers from school and family instability. The study indicates that youths who are engaged in risk behaviours are capable of making some changes to take positive paths in life. This qualitative study will present several stories of youths who share their transformation journey and it is our belief that there are more youths in such predicament who need to receive interventions through education and values just like others and be empowered in society to become productive citizens of the nation. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.},

abstract={The paper proposes a theoretical reflection on the link between the decline of free play among the children living in the modern societies and the educational poverty, that will be considered as a set of factors that prevent a person from learning and developing, completely, skills and talents, with negative impacts on the daily life. It is a polysemic term that indicates a link between material poverty, social exclusion, marginalization and lack of formal education, and, with a broader view, that encompasses different forms of social and cultural inequalities such school dropout, low level of quality of life, scarce opportunities to learn and play, absence of an adequate provision of cultural activities in the community, etc.The systematic observations on the habits of the children and the evidence that have been gathered provide a demonstration that the decline of the free play is negatively impacting the growth and the personal development of many children. We are witnessing today at the reduction of the time that children are allowed to play in a form that is independent, spontaneous and self-regulated.The lack of the fundamental steps that represent the basement for the correct personal growth is depriving them of those social skills that are crucial to assume a self-regulatory and independent attitude in their daily life. The negative effects of this phenomenon are impacting millions of children, preventing them to reach their full potential. Thus, there is an urgent need to stimulate a debate and develop the strategies that can mitigate the risks. © JPES.},

abstract={Background: Epilepsy remains a leading chronic neurological disorder in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. In Uganda, the highest burden is among young rural people. We aimed to; (i) describe socio-economic status (including schooling), and household poverty in adolescents living with epilepsy (ALE) compared to unaffected counterparts in the same communities and (ii) determine the factors associated with the overall quality of life (QoL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey nested within a larger study of ALE compared to age-matched healthy community children in Uganda. Between Sept 2016 to Sept 2017, 154 ALE and 154 healthy community controls were consecutively recruited. Adolescents recruited were frequency and age-matched based on age categories 10–14 and 15–19 years. Clinical history and standardized assessments were conducted. One control participant had incomplete assessment and was excluded. The primary outcome was overall QoL and key variables assessed were schooling status and household poverty. Descriptive and multivariable linear regression analysis were conducted for independent associations with overall QoL. Results: Mean (SD) age at seizure onset was 8.8 (3.9) years and median (IQR) monthly seizure burden was 2 (1–4). Epilepsy was associated with living in homes with high household poverty; 95/154 (61.7%) ALE lived in the poorest homes compared to 68/153 (44.5%) of the healthy adolescents, p = 0.001. Nearly two-thirds of ALE had dropped out of school and only 48/154 (31.2%) were currently attending school compared to 136/153 (88.9%) of healthy controls, p < 0.001. QoL was lowest among ALE who never attended school (p < 0.001), with primary education (p = 0.006) compared to those with at least secondary education. Stigma scores [mean(SD)] were highest among ALE in the poorest [69.1(34.6)], and wealthy [70.2(32.2)] quintiles compared to their counterparts in poorer [61.8(31.7)], medium [68.0(32.7)] and wealthiest [61.5(33.3)] quintiles, though not statistically significant (p = 0.75). After adjusting for covariates, ALE currently attending school had higher overall QoL compared to their counterparts who never attended school (β = 4.20, 95%CI: 0.90,7.49, p = 0.013). QoL scores were higher among ALE with ≥secondary education than those with no or primary education (β = 10.69, 95%CI: 1.65, 19.72). Conclusions: ALE in this rural area are from the poorest households, are more likely to drop out of school and have the lowest QoL. Those with poorer seizure control are most affected. ALE should be included among vulnerable population groups and in addition to schooling, strategies for seizure control and addressing the epilepsy treatment gap in affected homes should be specifically targeted in state poverty eradication programs. © 2020},

abstract={This article offers a phenomenological examination of the future orientation of 24 Muslim male high school dropout youth in Israel. This research is important in light of the multiple social exclusions, or structural vulnerabilities, these youths experience on the basis of poverty, stigmatized religious-national identity, and dropping out of school. The study's findings reveal three prominent future orientations: a refusal to engage in the future and a preference for examining the present; a closed future (expressed as a strong belief that the distant future will likely resemble the present); and a primary aspiration to become solo self-employed (i.e., occupationally independent), along with a unique rationale for explaining this aspiration. The Discussion expands on the impact of the youths’ structural vulnerability on their future orientation, the symbolism of their aspiration to be self-employed in the future, and the linkages between culture, future orientation, and inequality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Aim: To present a protocol study directed at tackling gender discrimination against Roma girls by empowering their mattering so they can envision their own futures and choose motherhood only if—and when—they are ready. Background: Motherhood among Roma girls (RGM) in Europe impoverishes their lives, puts them at risk of poor physical and mental health and precipitates school dropouts. Overwhelming evidence affirms that the conditions of poverty and the social exclusionary processes they suffer have a very important explanatory weight in their sexual and reproductive decisions. Methods: Through a Community-based Participatory Action Research design, 20–25 Roma girls will be recruited in each one of the four impoverished communities in Bulgaria, Romania and Spain. Data collection and analysis: Desk review about scientific evidences and policies will be carried out to frame the problem. Narratives of Roma women as well as baseline and end line interviews of girl participants will be collected through both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Quantitative data will be gathered through reliable scales of mattering, socio–political agency, satisfaction with life and self. A narrative analysis of the qualitative information generated in the interviews will be carried out. Expected results: (1) uncover contextual and psychosocial patterns of girl-motherhood among Roma women; (2) build critical thinking among Roma girls to actively participate in all decisions affecting them and advocate for their own gender rights within their communities; and (3) empower Roma girls and their significant adults to critically evaluate their own initiatives and provide feedback to their relevant stakeholders. Conclusions: Roma girls will improve their educational aspirations and achievements and their social status while respecting and enhancing Roma values. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Academic studies show that one of the main predictors of early school dropout at secondary education is student truancy behaviour, usually beginning at primary education. This is a problem that gets worse in socially vulnerable environments. This study analyses the prevalence and types of truancy in a population of students with high social risk in Madrid city, studying the relationship between truancy and their school performance. A questionnaire was answered by mentor teachers of students at the preschool and primary stages (N = 120), who reported information from a total of 433 students from 12 different schools. Results showed a high level of prevalence in the different types of truancy (Active and Passive). Among these behaviours, 46.86% of students skipped entire days without a valid excuse and 42.51% did not usually do their homework. Overall, 60% showed underachievement and great rates of curricular gap. In 6th grade, the last year of primary school, 74.42% of students had repeated one grade and 27.91% more than one. Moreover, significant correlations were found between truancy and school performance. The detection and early action against truancy in primary education with this type of student will reduce early dropouts and make school a key actor for the development of these students. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={School belonging is a topic of growing interest given its connection with school dropout, academic achievement, students’ behavior, and adolescent well-being. Until recently, most of this literature came from Anglo-Saxon contexts, mainstream schools, and quantitative analysis. As a result, there is still a research gap on this issue in different cultural contexts, social classes, and minority groups. This article makes a contribution exploring school belonging among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds, in an emerging economy (Mexico), and using a qualitative methodology that prioritize meanings and experiences of individuals. Focusing on three dimensions (stigmatization processes, school climate, and social relations with teacher and peers), we capture how the engagement of adolescents with their schooling process is shaped by institutional as well as sociocultural aspects. The study provides significant implications for a continuous professional development of high schools in disadvantaged contexts regarding student involvement, teacher support, and social recognition. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={The study examines the profile and livelihood strategies of the urban poor. Utilizing the primary data from three selected poverty prone areas in Accra, the study traces the migratory history of 216 poor urbanized youth and solicits how they cope with an urban livelihood. The findings show that respondents did not receive any formal social protection and informal support from family, and social clubs/associations were also minimal. Coping strategies adopted by these respondents included: petty trading (36.2 percent), street “kayayee” (kayaye is a local name given to head porters/truck pushers for a fee. It a common feature at the Central Business District of Accra; 25.5 percent), street hawking (12.8 percent), and truck pushing (10.6 percent). Some also get involved in illegal and immoral activities such as theft (in the case of males) and prostitution (in the case of the females). It is recommended that since most of them are school dropouts and above the age of availing themselves to the new free senior high school education being implemented by the government, both formal and informal skills (apprenticeship), and vocational training should be rigorously and diligently pursued to lift them out of poverty. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization},

abstract={Objective: Adolescence is a stage of natural vulnerability, where the environment plays an important role in protecting or putting adolescent girls at risk of pregnancy, which is an increasingly public health problem in developing countries. To understand this situation and promote preventive interventions, it is vital to study this population and the factors associated with the problem. Methods: A quantitative-analytical cross-sectional study of control cases was conducted in a population of adolescent women in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Results: We found a homogeneous group economically and demographically, of low scholarship and from low income families, and found protective factors such as the presence of functional family relationships with clear behavioral limits, participation on religious or non-religious youth groups which have had conversations about sexuality. As the main driver to pregnancy is school dropout, and the consequent perpetuation of poverty cycles. Conclusion: These findings suggest that preventive strategies for teenage pregnancy should be designed to provide education to both parents and adolescents in reproductive health issues within an emotional, trustworthy and free expression environment. © 2020, Nucleo de Estudos da Saude do Adolescente.

abstract={Background: Many children aged younger than 5 years living in low- and middle-income countries are at risk for poor development. Early child development (ECD) programs are cost-effective strategies to reduce poverty, crime, school dropouts, and socioeconomic inequality. With the spread of low-cost mobile phones and internet access in low- and middle-income countries, new service delivery models such as mobile phone–aided interventions have a great potential to improve early childhood development. Objective: This study aimed to identify the beliefs on importance of ECD, feasibility of a proposed intervention using mobile phones and factors that may affect the usability of the intervention among mothers of newborns in a poverty-stricken area in southwestern China. Methods: We conducted an in-depth, semistructured interview study of 25 low-income mothers of newborns recruited from two county hospitals in Yunnan Province. We applied the health belief model and cultural competence theories to identify the facilitators, barriers, and preferences among the target population for parenting knowledge. Results: The results showed that the participants had low health literacy and high perceived needs for learning ECD knowledge. At the same time, they experienced several barriers to learning parenting information and following evidence-based instructions including having limited time, limited financial resources, and different opinions on childcare among family members. Many participants preferred to receive personalized messages tailored to their specific needs and preferred videos or graphics to text only in the messages. Many favored a separate module to support postpartum mental health. Conclusions: The study assessed the acceptability of an early childhood intervention using mobile phones to meet the needs of the target population based on their beliefs, traits, and preferences and provided suggestions to refine the intervention to improve its usability. ©Donglan Zhang, Lan Jin, Di Liang, Ruijin Geng, Yun Liu, Yu Ling, Fan Jiang, Yunting Zhang.},

abstract={Education is important for the successful development and growth of individuals and societies, yet some factors adversely affect its provision. This article reports on a study that explored the factors that adversely affect education in the Builsa District located in the Upper East Region (UER) of Northern Ghana, by examining the attitudes and concerns of the people in Chuchuliga regarding education. Surveys were administered to students, parents/guardians and head teachers, and interviews and focus group discussions were held with opinion leaders and school dropouts, respectively. A striking finding was that the Tono Irrigation Dam located at Navrongo and farming, which is the predominant economic activity, negatively affect education in the community. Further findings were that the late introduction of education in Northern Ghana and traditional beliefs about education, as well as other long-established factors are responsible for high illiteracy and school-dropout rates. Recommendations to improve the quality of education in the district and country are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Unisa Press.},

abstract={Background Several studies have shown that leprosy, podoconiosis and lymphatic filariasis impact individual quality of life. In contrast, family quality of life has not received as much attention despite evidence that families are also affected. This is especially relevant given the crucial role of the family in most societies around the world. This study looks at the impact of lep-rosy, podoconiosis and lymphatic filariasis on family quality of life. Methodology The study used a cross-sectional design with a qualitative approach. Both semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted. Participants, persons affected and their family members, were selected by purposive sampling. Data were collected between August and November 2017 in Awi zone, Northwest Ethiopia and analysed by three independent researchers using open, inductive coding and content analysis. Results A total of 86 participants were included in this study: 56 participants in the in-depth interviews and 30 participants in the focus group discussions. We found that participation restric-tions, reduced productivity and marginalisation were common. In addition, discrimination in the communities occurred often, often extending to family members of persons affected. Divorce and difficulties in finding a spouse were common for persons affected and their family members. Many persons affected reported mental health problems. While most people got social and physical support from their families, there were a few exceptions. In particular, persons with younger children seemed to lack social support. Having to provide for their affected family member sometimes caused stress, school dropouts and an additional work-load. Financial problems and loss of livelihood were reported by almost all participants. Conclusion This study revealed that leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis have an effect on several dimensions of family quality of life. Many problems reported related to stigma and poverty. © 2020 van ‘t Noordende et al.},

abstract={In school age children and adolescents, anemia might cause lower cognitive function and attention span, which in turn could diminish human capital accumulation. As children born in low-income households are more likely to be anemic, this may prevent many individuals from overcoming the intergenerational poverty traps. In this paper, we used data from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 and focused on a sample of adolescents between 12 and 19 years of age to study the relationship between attending school without delay—our proxy for school performance—and anemia. We found a statistically significant association between the two variables. If this relationship is causal, the economic burden linked to the loss of school years could well exceed the costs associated with programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of anemia in vulnerable populations. Our results provide additional support to the existing literature on anemia as a significant barrier to school achievement. ©2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Introduction: Youth in disadvantaged urban areas are frequently exposed to chronic stress and trauma, including housing instability, neighborhood violence, and other poverty-related adversities. These exposures increase risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems and ultimately, school dropout. Schools are a promising setting in which to address these issues; however, there are few universal, trauma-informed school-based interventions for urban youth. Methods/Design: Project POWER (Promoting Options for Wellness and Emotion Regulation) is a randomized controlled trial testing the impact of RAP Club, a trauma-informed intervention for eighth graders that includes mindfulness as a core component. Students in 32 urban public schools (n = 800) are randomly assigned to either RAP Club or a health education active control group. We assess student emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes using self-report surveys and teacher ratings at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-month follow up. Focus groups and interviews with students, teachers, and principals address program feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity, as well as perceived program impacts. Students complete an additional self-report survey in ninth grade. Schools provide students' academic and disciplinary data for their seventh, eighth, and ninth grade years. In addition, data on program costs are collected to conduct an economic analysis of the intervention and active control programs. Discussion: Notable study features include program co-leadership by young adults from the community and building capacity of school personnel for continued program delivery. In addition to testing program impact, we will identify factors related to successful program implementation to inform future program use and dissemination. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Previous research suggests that both poverty and minority status significantly influence academic achievement. Nativity schools, which have been extensively researched, have been found effective for students coming from low socioeconomic statuses and diverse backgrounds. Differences were examined between an urban public school district and an urban parochial school that uses the Nativity model (henceforth referred to as Nativity School). The purpose of this study was to determine if students from Nativity School were able to achieve significantly above that which urban public school students achieved. Specifically, academic achievement in the areas of mathematics, language arts, and science were analyzed, as well as high school dropout rate, high school graduation rate, and entrance into postsecondary education. Nativity School used the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) to measure achievement longitudinally and reported stanines and local and national percentile ranks, while the public school system used the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) and provided four descriptor categories (i.e., Below Basic, Basic, Proficient, and Advanced). Below Basic and Basic referred to students who demonstrate the skills outlined by the Missouri Show-Me Standards inconsistently and/or incorrectly, while students who perform in the Proficient and Advanced categories demonstrate these skills consistently, at or above grade level. Results revealed Nativity School students significantly improved their academic achievement scores and were more likely than urban public school students to graduate high school and enroll in postsecondary school.

abstract={Primary and secondary education in Chile is free and mandatory by law according to the Chilean Constitution. Consequently, attendance of primary and secondary education is a fundamental human right in Chilean society. It is estimated that between 139,000 and 358,000 young people between six and 21 are outside the Chilean educational system. The goal of this study was to characterize students who dropped out of the regular school system and are currently attending re-entry schools. Using Latent Class Analysis we identified this population as a heterogeneous group of youths forming three distinct groups: newcomers, seniors, and complex. The characteristics of this population are different from two other comparative groups attending Preventive Programs and Socio-educational Programs. The students of re-entry schools are a group formed mostly by males who hastily leave formal education and with different amounts of school retardation. They have sociodemographic characteristics that hinder their educational trajectory-such as monetary poverty-but they have a low frequency of problems with the law and social protection measures. © 2020 PEL.},

abstract={Background The emergence of a large population of orphaned youth in sub-Saharan Africa is due to the natural maturity of orphaned children. Research indicates that orphaned youth face more negative psychosocial challenges than their younger counterparts do. Furthermore, these challenges are intensified for early school leavers. This paper describes how experiencing maternal death affects the psychosocial wellbeing of orphaned youth who left school before completing high school. Methods An exploratory qualitative study was undertaken among purposively sampled orphaned youth using in-depth interviews with open-ended questions. Fifty participants were recruited through social workers, community based organisations, and tribal authorities in a rural local municipality of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. All data analyses were performed using NVivo10, following an inductive thematic approach. Results The narratives with the participants revealed that they live in a socially depressed environment and are subjected to extreme poverty characterised by frequent hunger. Furthermore, they do not enjoy family support and when they live with their extended families, they experience ill treatment and unsympathetic gestures. The death of their mothers has made a negative psychological impact on their psychosocial wellbeing, resulting in the development of internalising depressive symptoms. They suffer from emotional distress and prolonged bereavement characterised by perpetual yearning for the mother and, they resort to silence as a coping strategy. The study established that they were forced to leave school early for a variety of reasons. However, leaving school early became a major stressor and contributed to their negative psychosocial wellbeing. Conclusion Maternal death has a negative impact on the psychosocial wellbeing of the participants even after they have crossed the 18 years threshold of orphan hood. Yearning for their mothers negatively affected their ability to develop coping strategies, which led to isolation, sadness, hopelessness, lack of peace, and fear of an uncertain future. The lack of routine screening for mental health in schools and other settings in South Africa increases their vulnerability to undiagnosed depression. The school health services should develop interventions for mental health screening in schools. For early school leavers, relevant policies should consider the continuation of support through NGOs and community networks. © 2020 Ntuli et al.

abstract={This study examines the impact of drinking water salinity on children's education using a unique and rich dataset collected from eight southwest coastal districts of Bangladesh. Salinity concentration in drinking water is measured at the household level using water samples from households' primary source of drinking water during the summer, wet and dry season of 20014−15. A third of the deep tube-well water samples was found to be slightly (1000 < TDS < 2000 mg/l) to moderately (TDS ≥ 2000 mg/l) saline. Linking the child-level data on educational outcome to water salinity (i.e. TDS level), the study reveals a statistically significant negative effect of excessive salinity on grade advancement for 7–12 year old children. More specifically, exposure to excessive drinking water salinity (TDS > 1000 mg/l) decreases the grade advancement likelihood of 7–12 year old children by 6.7 percentage points. The results remain robust to alternative model and econometric specifications. The adverse effect of salinity on grade advancement does not vary significantly across the gender of the child while poverty, as expected, exacerbates the effect. Impaired cognitive development due to early childhood exposure appears to be the most plausible channel through which the negative effects of excessive sodium consumption permeate to young children's educational deficit. Additionally, poor health of the adults and elevated medical expenditure play a small yet significant mediating role. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Preschool suspension and expulsion rates are typically based on teacher reports, and don't simultaneously account for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Objective: To examine estimates in the United States of parent-reported preschool suspension and expulsion rates, in the context of ACEs. Participants and setting: Parents of children aged 3–5 years old (N = 6,100) in the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health dataset. Method: We reported the prevalence estimates of preschool suspension and expulsion, and estimated the unique variance of ACEs as risk factors using weighted sequential logistic regression. Results: An estimated 174,309 preschoolers (2.0%) were suspended, and 17,248 (0.2%) children were expelled annually. If divided by 36 school weeks, the instances of weekly suspension and expulsion were at least 4,842 and 479 respectively. Controlling for previous risk factors (i.e., age, gender, race, ethnicity), the odds ratio increased by 80% for every unit of ACEs increment. Children were more likely to be suspended or expelled if they had domestic violence (OR = 10.6, p < .001), living with mental illness (OR = 9.8, p < .001), adult substance abuse (OR = 4.8, p < .001), and victim of violence (OR = 4.5, p = .004), living in high poverty (OR = 3.9, p = .001), divorced parents (OR = 3.3, p = .001), and parent incarceration (OR = 3.0, p = .009). Conclusion: The alarming suspension and expulsion rates call for more comprehensive outreach prevention and response efforts in preschool settings. Cross system collaboration and family support are essential to this work. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Despite inconclusive findings, educational researchers have long considered adequate parenting practices instrumental in preventing high school dropout among adolescents. The present short-term retrospective study focuses on parenting practices during middle adolescence when dropout typically occurs. Methods: The culturally diverse, high-risk sample of Canadian adolescents (N = 108; Mage = 16.0 years) from low-income neighborhoods included very recent dropouts and matched still-in-school students. A global score reflecting the quality of parenting practices during the period preceding dropout (or comparable period) was derived from adolescents’ answers to a well-established structured interview protocol. Transcripts of interviews were also used to identify the potentially disruptive challenges (e.g., parental incarceration) that families faced. Results: Results show a robust relationship between current parenting practices and dropout that was not moderated by challenging family circumstances or immigration history. Descriptive findings indicate that extreme and relatively rare cases of parental neglect were associated with a high dropout risk, but that most dropouts lived in families where communication and supervision, although not entirely absent, were minimal. Conclusion: Offering systematic support to parents of middle adolescents could help to prevent dropout in high-risk communities. © 2019 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents},

abstract={Regardless of remarkable educational achievements for over the last 20 years, the academic attainment of Vietnam’s ethnic minority students continues to lag behind that of majority students. At upper-secondary education, not only has the educational disparity persisted, but it has increased over time. Recent studies have found ethnic minority students have to face many challenges including poor family socioeconomic background, long distances to school, poor school quality, and linguistic and cultural barriers. Despite challenges, some ethnic minority youths do enroll in and complete their upper-secondary education. Therefore, understanding how ethnic minority students manage to overcome barriers and succeed educationally can provide important insights regarding the means that policymakers, educators, and parents can pursue in order to address the educational disparity. The resilience literature exploring association between household adversities and children’s responses indicates that hardship does not always result in detrimental effects. This study used a mixed-methods approach and explored data from the Families and Communities in Transition study to examine risks and factors promoting upper secondary education among the Thai youth, the second largest ethnic minority group in Vietnam. The study found that poverty, low educated parents, low parental engagement in child’s education, school distance, being bullied, teased, and induced to dropout were challenges to ethnic minority’s upper-secondary school. More importantly, the study provided supporting evidence for a positive attitude toward schooling and effective support from their parents, relatives, school and in-school peers can prevent ethnic minority student from school dropout and promote their educational success. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Mental Health of women is the most neglected area worldwide. In India due to poverty, unemployment, low level of education contributes to the inferior status of women in homes and in society. In addition, the introvert culture in many parts restricts the women any access to the health services leave along the mental health services. Under the circumstances the investigator seeks to do an in-depth study on, how the rural women are experiencing mental health problems and their coping strategies. Aim:To evaluate the perception of mental health problems and coping strategies practiced by rural women of the Vidarbha region. Research Design: Qualitative study Participants: Rural women above 18 years. Setting of the study: Two villages namely, Mohi and Ghorad; of Vidarbha region in Maharashtra state of Central India. Results: Married women had common somatic complaints like sleeping disorders, headache, chest pain, tiredness, and giddiness etc. not related to physical efforts. They were using certain maladaptive coping strategies like physically abusing their children, tobacco addiction and forcing their children for school dropout. Among the unmarried women, poor academic performance, school dropouts and peer and family pressure for early marriage were the major issues for mental distress leading to helplessness, and inadequate knowledge. Conclusion: The rural women perceive and attribute mental health problems to physical exertion and factors like lack of mental health care services. Hence a targeted intervention is needed to bring awareness among women of rural Vidarbha for promoting mental health and well-defined scientific coping strategies. © 2020 Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this article was to identify effective interventions to reduce secondary school dropout rates, increase the quality of learning in secondary schools in developing countries, and estimate the cost and educational impact of a sustained program to implement a selection of these interventions. Methods: Dropout risk is analyzed by multivariable regression using micro-datasets for 44 developing countries for which Demographic and Health Surveys are available. The analysis of interventions accesses recent meta-analyses of educational interventions in developing countries. We incorporate these results into a model of progression in secondary school—by grade, age, and gender, augmented by learning measures and by a facility to allow interventions to reduce dropout rates and improve learning—to estimate the impact and cost of a package of interventions out to 2030. Results: Poverty, female gender, and rural location are key risk factors for secondary school dropout. In terms of interventions, school proximity for rural students is critical. Better teaching both reduces dropout and improves learning, whereas instruction in the mother tongue improves also improves learning. Systematic implementation of nine interventions in the 44 countries, costing US$10.5 per capita per annum, would increase secondary completion rates by about 25% and more than double the index of learning achieved by 2030, with the effects being more pronounced in low-income countries. Conclusions: Powerful interventions are available to change the trajectory of schooling in developing countries but the costs are substantial, and a coordinated funding effort will be required. © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine},

abstract={Previous studies suggest that the roots of school dropout (a) can be established early in life, (b) are likely to involve multilevel factors (home, child, classroom) operating prior to and during the elementary school years, and (c) can be identified by 3rd grade. The decision to drop out of school is thus a dynamic developmental process that can begin with disengagement in elementary school. Yet few studies have examined the multilevel factors that might contribute to children's early disengagement from school. In the present study, we examined associations between household chaos (i.e., disorganization and instability) from birth to age 5 and student (dis)engagement in third grade. We also examined positive parenting in early childhood (6-60 months) and child self-regulatory skills at kindergarten as potential mediators in this pathway. Participants were 1,097 children who participated in the Family Life Project, a longitudinal study of the development of children living in underresourced high poverty rural areas. Study questions were addressed using structural equation models. Results indicated that, even after taking into account a considerable number of covariates, early positive parenting and children's self-regulatory skills were viable process mechanisms through which early household disorganization, but not instability, was linked to student (dis)engagement in third grade. Findings are discussed with respect to the multilevel proximal forces at play in children's risk for early disengagement from school. © 2019 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Background: Teen pregnancy is associated with increased risk of school dropout, employment challenges and long-term poverty; these risks are exacerbated for foster youth who are at elevated risk for teen pregnancy. Sex education and relationship education can facilitate the development of attitudes and skills associated with behaviors that reduce risky sexual behaviors. However, research on sex education with foster youth is limited as is research exploring the potential benefits of combining relationship education with sex education. Objective: This study examines variations in the experiences and outcomes of non-foster youth (n = 160) and foster youth (n = 165) who participated in a federally funded teen pregnancy prevention program that included both relationship and sex education. Methods: Path analysis models examined the relationship between several exogenous variables (i.e., youth characteristics, pre-program risky sexual behavior, program experience) and three endogenous variables (i.e., post-program perceived change in intercourse, condom use, and contraceptive use intentions). Multi-group analyses were used with foster youth status as a moderator to determine if the model was invariant by foster youth status. Results: Although foster youth entered programming with elevated rates of risky sexual behavior, both groups reported positive program experiences and safer sexual behavior intentions post-programming. Conclusion: Regardless of their elevated rates of risky sexual behavior prior to receiving programming, foster youth, like non-foster youth, may benefit from both relationship and sex education. For foster youth specifically, their positive program experience and reduced intentions to engage in risky sexual behaviors is an encouraging finding that contrasts with existing literature. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background Secondary education and delayed marriage provide long-term socio-economic and health benefits to adolescent girls. We tested whether a structural and norms-based intervention, which worked with adolescent girls, their families, communities, and secondary schools to address poverty, schooling quality and gender norms, could reduce secondary school drop-out and child marriage among scheduled-caste/scheduled-tribe (SC/ ST) adolescent girls in rural settings of southern India. Methods 80 of 121 villages in Vijayapura and Bagalkote districts, Karnataka State, were randomly selected (control = 40; intervention = 40). All 12-13 year-old SC/ST girls in final year of primary school (standard 7th) were enrolled and followed for 3 years (2014-2017) until the end of secondary school (standard 10th). Primary trial outcomes were proportion of girls who completed secondary school and were married, by trial end-line (15-16 years). Analyses were intention-to-treat and used individual-level girl data. Results 92.6% (2275/2457) girls at baseline and 72.8% (1788/2457) at end-line were interviewed. At end-line, one-fourth had not completed secondary school (control = 24.9%; intervention = 25.4%), and one in ten reported being married (control = 9.6%; intervention = 10.1%). These were lower than expected based on district-level data available before the trial, with no difference between these, or other schooling or sexual and reproductive outcomes, by trial arm. There was a small but significant increase in secondary school entry (adjusted odds ratio AOR = 3.58, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.36-9.44) and completion (AOR=1.54, 95%CI = 1.02-2.34) in Vijayapura district. The sensitivity and attrition analyses did not impact the overall result indicating that attrition of girls at end-line was random without much bearing on overall result. Conclusions Samata intervention had no overall impact, however, it added value in one of the two implementation districts-increasing secondary school entry and completion. Lower than expected school drop-out and child marriage rates at end-line reflect strong secular changes, likely due to large-scale government initiatives to keep girls in school and delay marriage. Although government programmes may be sufficient to reach most girls in these settings, a substantial proportion of SC/ST girls remain atrisk of early marriage and school drop-out, and require targeted programming. Addressing multiple forms of clustered disadvantage among hardest to reach will be key to ensuring India "leaves no-one behind" and achieves its gender, health and education Sustainable Development Goal aspirations. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Youth aging out of foster care are at particular risk for negative outcomes including school dropout, homelessness, poverty, unemployment, substance abuse, health and mental health problems, and victimization. Yet we know little about how, when, and why these youth find themselves on a downward trajectory. This qualitative, phenomenological study—conducted in partnership with four public child welfare agencies—examined the lived experience of 19 youth during their first year after exiting foster care. The authors used monthly, contemporaneous interviews to explore domains including housing, employment, education, and relationships with trusted adults. Although outcomes in employment were poorest, participants’ experience in all domains was characterized by frequent changes and instability. Adverse events began immediately and many youth were unsure how to navigate the system to get help. Yet youth who were successful in one domain were more likely to be successful in others. Risk factors included having four or more foster care placements, being on probation, accumulating fines, and losing government assistance. Protective factors included living with an adult who shares the rent and maintains a positive, consistent presence; being a full-time student; receiving educational and housing subsidies; having reliable means of transportation and communication; and maintaining the same job throughout the transitional year. Despite facing significant obstacles, the youth demonstrated resilience and optimism as they contemplated their futures. Recommendations include providing specialized services that target youth as they exit the system, and emphasizing stability rather than self-sufficiency. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Objective: The study was conducted to inform area-based prevention intervention programs and plan resource allocation to reduce new infections in the District of Columbia (DC), United States of America. Study design: The analysis used spatial regression to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of the new HIV rate and its association with sexually transmitted infection repeaters (STIREPs) and socio-economic as well as demographic characteristics. The HIV and STIREP data were obtained from the DC Department of Health surveillance data (2010–2016). Other covariates were obtained from the American Community Survey, 2016. Methods: Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to compare global and local relationships. GWR-computed robust results were compared with other spatial regression methods such as spatial lag or spatial error methods. Results: For the OLS model, age, high school dropouts (NHSD), and the black population had an association with new HIV diagnoses (HIVDV i ). The results from the GWR model demonstrate spatial variations of association of STIREPs; mean age of each block group; and percentage of female population, NHSD, unemployment, and poverty with HIVDV i . Akaike information criterion (AICc) value for the global model was 2770.99, and R 2 was 0.54 (54%). The R 2 and AICc of the GWR model was 0.81 (81%) and 2580.84, respectively, where the latter showed a 0.27 (27%) increase in R 2 and a decreased AICc. Conclusion: These results will assist in planning HIV prevention and intervention strategies. These results will also be used for targeted testing, planning pre-exposure prophylaxis, and access to health care. The results will help plan resource allocation to community-based providers for prevention intervention programs and fund public health programs such as condom distribution, mobile vans, and youth-based sex education. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health},

abstract={Many approaches are available to researchers who wish to measure individuals' exposure to environmental conditions. Different approaches may yield different estimates of associations with health outcomes. Taking adolescents' exposure to alcohol outlets as an example, we aimed to (1) compare exposure measures and (2) assess whether exposure measures were differentially associated with alcohol consumption. Methods: We tracked 231 adolescents 14-16 years of age from the San Francisco Bay Area for 4 weeks in 2015/2016 using global positioning systems (GPS). Participants were texted ecologic momentary assessment surveys six times per week, including assessment of alcohol consumption. We used GPS data to calculate exposure to alcohol outlets using three approach types: residence-based (e.g., within the home census tract), activity location-based (e.g., within buffer distances of frequently attended places), and activity path-based (e.g., average outlets per hour within buffer distances of GPS route lines). Spearman correlations compared exposure measures, and separate Tobit models assessed associations with the proportion of ecologic momentary assessment responses positive for alcohol consumption. Results: Measures were mostly strongly correlated within approach types (ρ ≥ 0.7), but weakly (ρ < 0.3) to moderately (0.3 ≤ ρ < 0.7) correlated between approach types. Associations with alcohol consumption were mostly inconsistent within and between approach types. Some of the residence-based measures (e.g., census tract: β = 8.3, 95% CI = 2.8, 13.8), none of the activity location-based approaches, and most of the activity path-based approaches (e.g., outlet-hours per hour, 100 m buffer: β = 8.3, 95% CI = 3.3, 13.3) were associated with alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Methodologic decisions regarding measurement of exposure to environmental conditions may affect study results. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Substance use has a tremendous impact on the burden of disease. This is particularly true in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR), where many countries serve as suppliers of drugs. As risk perception and frequency of use are inversely correlated, targeting perception during adolescence becomes essential for prevention. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature on attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge of substance use amongst youth in the EMR. Methods: We reviewed quantitative articles addressing attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge of youth aged between 13 and 25 years towards substance use in the EMR. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles then applied a duplicate independent method for study selection and screening. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and a narrative summary of findings. Results: Our search generated 12,810 articles. Five cross-sectional studies were eligible (two analytic and three descriptive). The analytic studies described a significant correlation between intention to use and both attitudes and subjective norms. The descriptive studies portrayed a negative attitude towards use with a low threshold for considering it as serious. Beliefs pertaining to reasons for use included stress and sleeping, whereas thoughts on treatment were restricted to traditional methods based on personal resilience and religious support. Knowledge about substance use symptoms, withdrawal, and treatment was low. Conclusion: Our review ascertains the role of sociocultural moral prohibition and awareness of mental health as major influencers in shaping the perception of substance use. Further research is needed to elaborate culturally-tailored survey tools. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Youths living with HIV/AIDS (YLWHA) experience innumerable challenges within schools and the larger community. Nonetheless, these environments are potential sources of support for such youths. This review provides a synthesis of evidence about these challenges and support available for YLWHA to inform the design and implementation of interventions that support the wellbeing of youths living with HIV/AIDS in an East African context. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Cochrane central registry of systematic reviews and randomized control trials for studies conducted in East Africa and published in English in the last 10 years (March 2007 to March 2017). We also searched Google Scholar and reference lists of all included studies. We purposed to include both qualitative and quantitative data but no quantitative data merited inclusion. We analyzed qualitative data using a framework thematic analysis. Results: We included 16 primary studies conducted in clinic and community settings that used qualitative or mixed methods. Three overarching themes - psychosocial wellbeing, treatment and health, and disclosure of HIV status together with a sub-theme of stigma that was important across the three overarching themes - were the basis for analysis. In each overarching theme, a duality of challenges versus support was reported. Psychosocial wellbeing included subthemes of challenges in schools and larger community, financial challenges, domestic violence, sexual and reproductive health challenges, and psychosocial support. Conclusion: YLWHA experience numerous challenges and support needs, some of which occur in schools and affect their QoL. The effects of these challenges are poor health and educational outcomes as well as school dropout. The schools in which youths spend most of their formative years have not provided adequate support for YLWHA. This review identified that although most of the challenges that studies identified arose from within schools and that a few supportive approaches were available, none of the studies explored how these supportive approaches would work in schools. It was additionally identified that stigma complicates challenges of living with HIV/AIDS necessitating interventions for the wellbeing of YLWHA to understand and address HIV-stigma and its ramifications. Such interventions ought to be sustainable in schools, culturally appropriate, and multidisciplinary in order to promote the general health of all students. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={School dropouts have negative consequences for the social, political, environmental and economic development of a country. This study aims to determine the economic effect of school dropout in the context of Bangladesh. It also explores the factors associated with school dropout in Bangladesh. An extensive review of the literature has been performed especially on international peer-reviewed research articles. Studies have been assessed on some pre-defined domains like reasons for school dropout, social, economic, political, and environmental factor, government initiatives to reduce dropout, school’s study environment, geographical factors, social norms and values, and expert opinion. The study reveals that school dropout is negatively related to economic development in Bangladesh. The study also explores that chronic poverty, parent’s unwillingness, financial problem, school’s poor infrastructure, biased social practice, lack of quality education, geographic isolation, unequal access to education, and security problems for girls are major causes of school dropout in Bangladesh. The study suggests that free education program, reducing paid coaching culture, lessening cost of private school, raising awareness of parents by teacher-parents relationship, improving school’s infrastructure, ensuring equal access to education, providing quality training for teachers, provision of all related facilities should be ensured at the policy level by government's policymakers. © 2019, International Journal of Information and Education Technology.

abstract={Background This study aimed to increase understanding of the clustering of sexual behaviors in an urban sample of emerging adults, and the individual and neighborhood factors associated with sexual behavior patterns to provide insight into reducing the disproportionate burden of poor sexual outcomes among urban African Americans. Methods We draw on 2 cohorts of urban, predominantly African American youth first assessed at age 6 years and follow-up to emerging adulthood (mean age, 20 years; n = 1618). Latent class analyses by gender identified co-occurrence of sexual behavior. Results We found 3 classes for both males and females: high-risk (13% of males, 15% of females), low-risk (54% of males, 56% of females) and no-risk (33% of males, 29% of females). Membership in the high-risk class was associated with school dropout, a substance use disorder diagnosis, having a criminal arrest, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases for both males and females. High-risk females also had higher rates of depression. Low-risk males and females also had elevated risk of pregnancy and parenthood. Neighborhood factors distinguished the high- and no-risk classes for males and females, including the neighborhood environment scale, which assessed poverty, safety, drug activity, and crime/violence in the neighborhood. Neighborhood religiosity was inversely associated with membership in the high-risk class compared with the no-risk class for females only. Neighborhood racism distinguished those in the high-risk class compared with the no-risk class for males. Conclusions Future work should take into account the clustering of sexual risk behaviors. Specific neighborhood factors could be addressed to reduce sexual health disparities. © Copyright 2018 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Malawi has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates worldwide; at 141 births/1000 girls it is 3-fold higher than the global average. Adolescent pregnancy contributes to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, school dropout, and poverty. In preparation for an information, education, and communication (IEC) intervention to reduce unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls, formative research was conducted to understand how and what sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information is shared with girls in southern, rural Malawi, and perceptions of such information among key informants. Methods: Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with three participant groups: adolescent girls (n = 18), mothers/female guardians (M/FGs) of adolescent girls (n = 12), and leaders of initiation rites (n = 10). Interviews were conducted in 15 villages. Data were analyzed and coded using Dedoose 7.5. Results: Participants widely acknowledged both the health risks and the general social unacceptability of early childbearing, yet adolescent pregnancy is common in the region. Respondents also acknowledged the importance of female school completion and the norm that pregnancy usually marks the end of a girl's education. Unprotected transactional sex was reported to be common and driven by poverty. Initiation rites were described as prevalent and often encourage girls to practice sex at puberty. Contraceptives, and even condoms, were reportedly discouraged for adolescents due to concerns about inappropriateness for nulliparous and young girls and misconceptions about side effects. Adolescent respondents also noted barriers to accessing condoms and contraceptives. M/FGs were described as gatekeepers to SRH information and services, and many parents reported delaying SRH discussions until after sexual debut due to concerns about encouraging sexual activity. Adolescent and M/FG participants expressed a desire for role models or "outside experts" to provide SRH education and to promote an alternate vision to adolescent motherhood. Conclusion: To improve SRH outcomes for adolescent girls, it is critical to engage key stakeholders and create an enabling environment so that girls can effectively act on the IEC they receive. Initiation counselors remain entrenched information sources; efforts to provide them with training on accurate SRH messaging could leverage an existing channel. Engaging parents, especially mothers, is crucial to encourage earlier SRH education and to gain their acceptance of adolescent access to SRH services. Also important is mobilizing the broader community of influencers in support of girls' SRH and vision for a healthier future. Sensitization messages focusing on the health, educational and economic benefits of preventing early pregnancy may overcome misconceptions about and barriers to contraceptive use. Finally, fostering girls' aspirations for school completion and jobs and other income generating opportunities via role models can encourage an alternative to adolescent motherhood. Ultimately, poverty and gender inequity reduction is critical for long-lasting impact on the SRH of adolescent girls in the region. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Cash Transfer (CT) schemes have become popular poverty reducing measures in many low and middle-income countries. Research indicates that when provided to girls in resource poor settings, cash transfers can increase education and postpone marriage and pregnancy. However, a few studies indicate that they can also have negative effects which can affect their acceptability, such as generating intra-community tensions. Objective: Conceptually informed by Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory, this paper explores factors affecting the acceptability of economic support in a randomized controlled trial in rural Monze and Pemba Districts of Southern Province in Zambia. Methods: Qualitative data were collected through five focus group discussions and six in-depth, semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. This study was done in the combined arm of a trial where girls received both economic support and participated in youth clubs offering sexuality and life-skills education. Results: In the study communities, acceptability was encouraging by the belief that economic support provided benefits beyond beneficiaries and that it improved access to education, and reduced teen pregnancies, marriages and school drop-out. However, provision of economic support only to selected girls and their parents and fear among some that the support was linked to satanic practices negatively affected acceptability. These fears were mitigated through community sensitisations. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that relative advantage, observability, simplicity and compatibility were key factors in influencing acceptability of the economic support. However, to enhance acceptability of cash transfer schemes aimed at addressing early marriage and pregnancy, it is important to explore socio-cultural factors that create suspicions and negative perceptions and to provide schemes that are perceived as relatively better than available similar schemes, understood, compatible and viable beyond the immediate beneficiary. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Background: As populations of refugee children increase globally, strategies for providing quality and relevant educational experiences for this group of children has become a priority. This is because research suggests that refugee children tend to experience higher school dropout rates due to, among other factors, poverty, lack of shelter and inadequate nutrition. Aim: This article reports on an exploratory study of Grade R teachers’ interactions with refugee children in a child care centre in Durban and the ways in which these might contribute to the children’s readiness for Grade 1 in mainstream schools. Setting: The study was located in a Grade R class in a Durban refugee child care centre catering for children from neighbouring African countries. Methods: The study adopted a qualitative ethnographic approach involving classroom and playground observations, as well as informal open-ended interviews with the Grade R teacher and her assistant. Results: The findings suggest that several factors, including a high teacher–learner ratio (1:48), poor classroom management and pedagogical practices, inadequate and inappropriate resources and a lack of professional development opportunities for teachers influenced the nature of interactions between the refugee children and their teachers. Conclusions: The findings have negative implications for the children’s readiness for Grade 1 and beyond. The findings suggest that unless the provision of early childhood development and education (ECDE) in this centre is significantly improved, for example, by addressing the factors identified in the study, the refugee children in the facility will continue to be poorly prepared for mainstream schooling. © 2019.

abstract={Emotions are individual traits for different sort of people especially for deprivation in the society, age long marginalization, inaccessibility of basic infrastructures, poverty etc. The vulnerabilities among tribal students can be understood and analyzed using the sophisticated technologies. Face detection and recognition of ahuman is an essential move in deep learning framework. Human emotion recognition assumes to be vital in finding out the vulnerabilities of individuals.The automatic identification of emotions had been a consistent research theme from early time periods.There has been a few advancements made in this fieldusing automatic identification of face emotion. Feelings are reflected from facial expressions, hand and signals of the body and through outward appearances. Thus understanding and extraction of these emotions have a high significance in the collaboration among human and machine correspondence.The paper aims to detect face emotions and annotates the every human in a given video using a combination of computational analysis, manual annotation, and experimental validation. The technique can be applicable for Tribal school kids for understanding the emotions. The system can recognize the emotion of kids and can authenticate the person.It can also be used in detecting and annotating unauthorized entries in restricted areas. Through the gaming platforms it is easy to attract the tribal students and to analyze their emotions and plan the developmental aspects based on the outcome. It will also help to understand the specific reasons of school dropouts and other issues students in tribal community face. Teachers can develop a framework using the reportfrom the application to improve the educational qualities of students. It can be concluded that Deep learning architecture –Convolution Neural Network is able to accurately classify the emotions. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={Child marriages in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and around the world have been associated with enormous complications, especially relating to the developmental potential of young girls/women within society. SSA is confronted with the issue of child marriages and seemingly with governments failing to clamp down on the practice. Child marriages have continued to manifest themselves, especially in deep rural areas where traditional beliefs are still rife. The study used a qualitative research method were the systematic review of the literature relating to child marriages and their implications was undertaken. Apart from an extensive literature search, the study utilized thematic content analysis to deduce its findings, with the hope of bringing in more meaning to the overall content of the paper. The literature pointed out that poverty, inequality and a slow government response, contributes to increased child marriages. Furthermore, the failure to develop, implement and enforce policies is another major contributing factor. Thematic content analysis was used to identify analyse and report patterns of themes that emerged from the data analysis. The implications of child marriage include; early school dropout, early pregnancy and the increased possibility of domestic violence. The study concludes that better access to support services and education is key in ensuring that the governments in SSA are able to better position themselves, in dealing with child marriages in the region. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

abstract={This paper sought to investigate vulnerability of the girl child as a child protection concern in fishing camps in Binga, Zimbabwe. The paper discusses the factors attracting the girl child in fishing camps, the protection challenges the girl child faced and the vulnerability indicators of the girl child in fishing camps. A qualitative methodology was employed through the use of focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews. A purposive sample of 15 girls under the age of 18 years and 5 key informants was drawn. Findings of the study indicated that poverty was the main drive for the girl children to flock to the fishing camps in Binga. Records of early marriages, teenage pregnancies, HIV/ AIDS infection, school dropout and sexual abuse and exploitation were prone in the study area. Girls’ vulnerability in fishing camps in Binga creates an alarm for the duty bearers to focus their attention towards assisting the succumbing girl child. Though the study focused on the girl child, there is need to consider a separate study for the other social groups. © Kamla-Raj 2018.},

abstract={Estimate by different National and International organizations stated that there are more than 20 million Indian children‟s are employed in some productive, hazardous and unhygienic occupation. A number of reasons attributed for this growing menace. Poverty and school dropouts are the two most causes for this problem. 70 child labourers working in different unorganized mechanical engineering industries of Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu were selected by using stratified random sampling method. The present study was aimed at analyzing the reasons for entering this child labour and finding their socio-economic problems. The study found that child labourers are working unhygienic and unsafe places. This study found that many of them are getting less paid compared to the common workers. These child laboures are the marginal group of the society and denied to access their most of the basic rights. School dropouts were the major reason for entering this occupation. Whether they like it or not they supposed to continue this work to solve family economic problems. Appropriate policy measures were suggested to solve the child labour problem. More number of empirical studies is needed in this area to eradicate the child labourer in all kind of industries. © IAEME Publication},

abstract={Objective: To estimate the past-year prevalence of parental use of verbal and physical discipline in an urban sample. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two underprivileged neighborhoods with nearly 80,000 inhabitants. Complex sampling was used. The households were selected by applying two-stage probabilistic sampling with stratification. A total of 401 households (sample error = 0.1) were selected by maximizing the variance (p = 0.5). The cluster sampling indicated 33 census units (sample error = 0.05). The Brazilian Portuguese version of the WorldSAFE Core Questionnaire was used to assess parental use of moderate verbal discipline, harsh verbal discipline, moderate physical discipline, and harsh physical discipline. This questionnaire asks how often mothers (respondent) and/or their husband or partner use specific disciplinary tactics. Results: The mean age of children and adolescents was 9 years (SD: 4.5). The prevalence of harsh verbal discipline was approximately 37% (28.3% [95% CI: 23.4–33.3%] for more than three times). The prevalence of harsh physical discipline was approximately 30% (21.8% [CI: 18.2–25.4%] for more than three times). Boys had higher odds of receiving harsh physical discipline [OR: 1.56, p < 0.05]. Children and adolescents with learning problems and developmental delays had higher odds of being exposed to harsh discipline than their peers without these problems. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma) had lower odds of receiving harsh physical discipline (OR: 0.4; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Parental abuse was embedded within children and adolescents rearing practices in these two underprivileged neighborhoods. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria},

abstract={Research on neighborhood effects has increasingly focused on how long children have lived in a deprived neighborhood during childhood (duration), but has typically ignored when in childhood the exposure occurred (timing) and whether neighborhood circumstances were improving or deteriorating (sequencing). In this article, the authors applied sequence analysis to simultaneously capture children’s duration, timing, and sequencing of exposure to neighborhood (dis)advantage in childhood. Logistic regression analysis was subsequently used to test how different patterns of exposure are related to teenage parenthood, school dropout, and delinquent behavior. Using register data from the Netherlands, an entire cohort was followed from birth in 1995 up until age 19 in 2014 (N = 168,645, 48.8% females, 83.2% native Dutch). Compared to children who had lived in a deprived neighborhood throughout childhood, children who were exposed to neighborhood deprivation only during adolescence were found to be equally likely to become a teenage parent and were even more likely to drop out of school. Unexpectedly, children who had lived in an affluent neighborhood throughout childhood were most likely to engage in delinquent behavior. Possible explanations and implications are discussed. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: South Africa remains the global epicentre of HIV infection, and adolescent women have the highest incidence of HIV in the country. South Africa also has high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, violence, and gender inequality. Violence converges with AOD use, gender inequities and other disparities, such as poverty, to increase sexual risk and poor educational attainment for adolescent women. This study seeks to test the efficacy of peer recruitment and cofacilitation of the Young Women's Health CoOp (YWHC), a comprehensive gender-focused intervention to reduce HIV risk behaviours and increase the uptake of HIV counselling and testing (HCT) among out-of-school, adolescent women who use AODs. The YWHC is facilitated by local research staff and supported by peers. Methods: This cluster-randomised trial is enrolling participants into two arms: a control arm that receives standard HCT, and an intervention arm that receives the YWHC. Participants are enrolled from 24 economically disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa. These geographically distinct communities serve as clusters that are the units of randomisation. This study uses adolescent peer role models and research field staff to recruit marginalised adolescent women. At baseline, participants complete a questionnaire and biological testing for HIV, recent AOD use, and pregnancy. The core intervention is delivered in the month following enrollment, with linkages to health services and educational programmes available to participants throughout the follow-up period. Follow-up interviews and biological testing are conducted at 6 and 12 months post enrollment. Discussion: The study findings will increase knowledge of the efficacy of a comprehensive HCT, gender-focused programme in reducing AOD use, victimisation, and sexual risk behaviour and increase uptake services for out-of-school, adolescent women who use AODs. The trial results could lead to wider implementation of the YWHC for vulnerable adolescent women, a key population often neglected in health services. Trial registration: Trial registration no: NCT02974998, November 29, 2016. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper provides an original contribution concerning the influence of microcredit on child school dropout rates in the poorest regions in Vietnam. Two crucial empirical problems for the linkage between microfinance and children's education are sample selection bias and the endogeneity of microcredit. Using a combination of the instrumental variable method and the Heckman approach to overcome these problems, the finding is that microcredit increases the opportunity for households to send their children to school through two main channels—increasing household per capita income and moving households out of poverty. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Adolescent pregnancy remains a global health concern, contributing to 11% of all births worldwide and 23% of the overall burden of disease in girls aged 15-19 years. Premature motherhood can create a negative cycle of adverse health, economic and social outcomes for young women, their babies and families. Refugee and migrant adolescent girls might be particularly at risk due to poverty, poor education and health infrastructure, early marriage, limited access to contraception and traditional beliefs. This study aims to explore adolescents' perceptions and experiences of pregnancy in refugee and migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Methods: In June 2016 qualitative data were collected in one refugee camp and one migrant clinic along the Thailand-Myanmar border by conducting 20 individual interviews with pregnant refugee and migrant adolescents and 4 focus group discussions with husbands, adolescent boys and non-pregnant girls and antenatal clinic staff. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify codes and themes emerging from the data. Results: Study participants perceived adolescent pregnancy as a premature life event that could jeopardise their future. Important themes were premarital sex, forced marriage, lack of contraception, school dropout, fear of childbirth, financial insecurity, support structures and domestic violence. Supportive relationships with mothers, husbands and friends could turn this largely negative experience into a more positive one. The main underlying reasons for adolescent pregnancy were associated with traditional views and stigma on sexual and reproductive health issues, resulting in a knowledge gap on contraception and life skills necessary to negotiate sexual and reproductive choices, in particular for unmarried adolescents. Conclusions: Adolescents perceive pregnancy as a challenging life event that can be addressed by developing comprehensive adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health services and education in refugee and migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Creating a more tolerant and less stigmatising environment in these communities and their governing bodies will help to achieve this goal. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Harmful gender norms are known structural barriers to many public health and development interventions involving adolescent girls. In India, restrictions on girls' liberty to move freely in public spaces contribute to school dropout and early marriage, and negatively affect girls' health and wellbeing, from adolescence into adulthood. We report on mechanisms of change among female mentors 18 to 24 years old who contested discriminatory norms while implementing a sports-based programme for adolescent girls in a Mumbai slum. Methods: We adopted a prospective qualitative research design. Our analysis is based on case studies derived from two rounds of face to face, in -depth interviews with 10 young women recruited to serve as mentors for the project's young female athletes. We combined both thematic and narrative analysis. Results: The programme created opportunities for collective action, increasing mentors' ability to think and relate in a collectivized manner, and challenged the traditional female identity constructed for young women, which centres on domestic duties. The mentors themselves negotiated freedoms both in and outside their homes, which required careful and strategic bargaining. They changed the nature of key day-to-day social interactions with parents and brothers, as well as with neighbours, parents of their groups of athletes and men on the streets. They formed a new reference group for each other in terms of what was possible and acceptable. Demonstrating greater negotiation skills within the family helped win parents' trust in the mentor's ability to be safe in public spaces. Parents became active supporters by not giving into social sanctions of neighbours and relatives thus co-producing a new identity for their daughters as respectable young women doing 'good work'. They effectively side stepped reputational risk with their presence in public spaces becoming de-sexualised. Conclusions: Mentors contested mobility restrictions by taking risks as a group first, with collective agency an important step towards greater individual agency. This research provides important insights into addressing embedded social norms that perpetuate gender discriminatory practices and the social patterning of health inequalities. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={IMPORTANCE Educational attainment is the leading social determinant of health, but few studies of prevention programs have examined whether the programs are associated with educational attainment outcomes after the mid-20s, especially for large-scale programs that provide a longer duration of services. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between a preschool to third grade intervention and educational attainment at midlife and differences by program duration, sex, and parental educational level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This matched-group, alternative intervention study assessed 1539 low-income minority children born in 1979 or 1980 who grew up in high-poverty neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. The comparison group included 550 children primarily from randomly selected schools participating in the usual early intervention. A total of 989 children who entered preschool in 1983 or 1984 and completed kindergarten in 1986 were included in the Chicago Longitudinal Study and were followed up for 27 to 30 years after the end of a multicomponent intervention. A total of 1398 participants (90.8%) in the original sample had educational attainment records at 35 years of age. The study was performed from January 1, 2002, through May 31, 2015. INTERVENTIONS The Child-Parent Center Program provides school-based educational enrichment and comprehensive family services from preschool to third grade (ages 3-9 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Educational outcomes from administrative records and self-report included school dropout, 4-year high school graduation, years of education, postsecondary credential, and earned degrees from associate's to master's or higher. RESULTS A total of 1539 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.1 [0.32] years; 1423 [92.9%] black and 108 [7.1%] Hispanic) were included in the study. After weighting on 2 propensity scores, preschool participants had higher rates of postsecondary degree completion, including associate's degree or higher (15.7%vs 10.7%; difference, 5.0%; 95%CI, 1.0%-9.0%), master's degree (4.2%vs 1.5%; difference, 2.7%; 95%CI, 1.3%-4.1%), and years of education (12.81 vs 12.32; difference, 0.49; 95%CI, 0.20-0.77). Duration of participation showed a consistent linear association with outcomes. Compared with fewer years, preschool to second or third grade participation led to higher rates of associate's degree or higher (18.5%vs 12.5%; difference, 6.0%; 95%CI, 1.0%-11.0%), bachelor's degree (14.3%vs 8.2%; difference, 6.1%; 95%CI, 1.3%-10.9%), and master's degree or higher (5.9%vs 2.3%; difference, 3.6%; 95%CI, 1.4%-5.9%). The pattern of benefits was robust and favored male participants for high school graduation, female participants for college attainment, and those from lower-educated households. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study indicates that an established early and continuing intervention is associated with higher midlife postsecondary attainment. Replication and extension of findings to other locations and populations should further strengthen confidence in the health benefits of large-scale preventive interventions.},

funding_text 1={On the face of it, South African universities are working on decolonizing their academic offerings. Most have created committees to review their curricula — although few have much to show for it. And all are under pressure from government and funding bodies to train and hire more black academics. Research funders are following suit. A few years ago, the Medical Research Council dedicated a significant portion of its largest grant programme to early-career scientists, and added weighting for gender and race. The proportion of the grants going to white investigators has since shrunk, from 72% in 2012 to 37% in 2016. The council is also working on a position statement on decolonization to sharpen its efforts to recruit black scientists, says Glenda Gray, the council’s president (see ‘Three cultures’). It will look at how medical research can draw on social science to become more sensitive to community needs. “You only get true well-being if you understand the context in which the biological happens.”},

abstract={Neighbourhoods and families are key social institutions instilled with development of early life course of adolescents. Limited research in India has examined exposure to community along with socioeconomic conditions for school-dropouts of girls. Multidimensional benefits of female education are increasingly recognized in recent years; hence, it becomes imperative to study the community components of school discontinuation particularly in rural area. This study aims to analyse effect of mother's education, community poverty, and gender equitable attitudes associated with a girl's school dropout. This study uses baseline survey data from an intervention program from poor-performing districts of India. Collinearity among individual predictors validated by variance inflation factor proceeded step-wise binary-logistic regression. Result suggests that communities with high concentrations of poverty and mother illiteracy are disadvantages with low gender perception and high levels of dropouts. Result suggests that girls living in poor communities are three times more likely to dropout and 70% more if belonged to communities with lower mother literacy. Girls who scored low on Gender Equitable Scale had less probability to dropout. The study concludes that girls from poor communities with low levels of mother literacy and non-egalitarian gender attitudes are at higher risk of school dropout. © 2018 Rachana Patel et al.},

abstract={There are several signs that many young people with a migrant background feel less attachment to their social environment and institutions (Pels, 2008; Van Bergen, Feddes, Doosje, & Pels, 2015). This marginalized position is often seen as a possible explanation for their over-representation in problem behaviours such as crime, drug use or school dropouts (Junger-Tas, Steketee & Moll, 2008; Junger-Tas et al., 2010). Migrant families live more often in disadvantaged residential areas because of their high levels of unemployment and economic deprivation. Neighbourhoods with poor living standards, poverty and population instability suffer from high crime levels. Residential turnover weakens social bonds and social control in these districts (De Winter, Horjus, & van Dijken, 2009; Shaw & McKay, 1942). According to social bonding or control theory (Hirschi, 1969), weakened social bonds are considered the main cause of criminal behaviour. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Background: Our objective in this study was to find determinants of high-school dropout in a deprived area of Japan using longitudinal data, including socio-demographic and junior high school-period information. Methods: We followed 695 students who graduated the junior high school located in a deprived area of Japan between 2002 and 2010 for 3 years after graduation (614 students: follow-up rate, 88.3%). Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to calculate the prevalence ratios (PRs) for high-school dropout, using multiple imputation (MI) to account for non-response at follow-up. Results: The MI model estimated that 18.7% of students dropped out of high school in approximately 3 years. In the covariates-adjusted model, three factors were significantly associated with high-school dropout: ≥10 days of tardy arrival in junior high school (PR 6.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69–24.6 for “10–29 days of tardy arrival” and PR 8.01; 95% CI, 2.05–31.3 for “≥30 days of tardy arrival” compared with “0 day of tardy arrival”), daily smoking (PR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.41–2.86) and severe problems, such as abuse and neglect (PR 1.66; 95% CI, 1.16–2.39). Among students with ≥30 days of tardy arrival in addition to daily smoking or experience of severe problems, ≥50% high-school dropout rates were observed. Conclusions: Three determinants of high-school dropout were found: smoking, tardy arrival, and experience of severe problems. These factors were correlated and should be treated as warning signs of complex behavioral and academic problems. Parents, educators, and policy makers should work together to implement effective strategies to prevent school dropout. © 2018 Takahiro Tabuchi et al.},

abstract={This study, aimed at determining the reasons for dropouts of the formal secondary education of girls living in rural areas, employed phenomenological methodology from the qualitative research approaches. The study group includes 30 female students, who live in a town in the Black Sea Region of Turkey and who dropped out of formal secondary education, and their parents. The data were collected by interview technique. In the interviews, personal, social, economic and cultural information about the students and the families, and the reasons why the children did not attend school were obtained. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique. Precautions were taken to increase the validity and reliability of the data collection, processing and analysis processes. As a result, the vital causes for school dropout of the girls in the study group were found as insecurity, conservatism, poverty, and failure. The school dropout of the majority of children is resulted from two or more reasons coming together. Insecurity / conservatism, insecurity / poverty and insecurity / conservatism / poverty are the leading reasons for the girls leaving the school in the study group. The combination of reasons for dropout differs from student to student. It is suggested that, within this context, preventive measures for student dropouts should be diversified by the goverment on a student basis. © 2014 Eǧitim ve Bilim Dergisi.},

abstract={Maltreated youth have higher rates of school dropout than their non-maltreated peers. School connectedness is a modifiable predictor of school success. We hypothesized maltreated youth's school connectedness (supportive relationships with adults at school and participation in school clubs) would be positively associated with high school graduation. We included youth with at least one Child Protective Services (CPS) report by age twelve from Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect, a prospective cohort study. Participation in extracurricular activities and adult relationships reported at age 16, high school graduation/General Education Development (GED) status reported at age 18, and demographics were provided by youth and caregivers. Maltreatment data were coded from CPS records. The outcome was graduation/receipt of GED. Multivariable logistic regressions examined the association between school connectedness and graduation/receipt of GED, controlling for confounders. In our sample of 318 maltreated youth, 73.3% graduated. School club was the only activity with a statistically significant association with graduation in bivariate analysis. Having supportive relationships with an adult at school was not significantly associated with graduation, though only 10.7% of youth reported this relationship. Maltreated youth who participated in school clubs had 2.54 times the odds of graduating, adjusted for study site, gender, poverty status, caregiver high school graduation status, and age at first CPS report (95% CI: [1.02, 6.33]). Few maltreated youth reported relationships with adults at school, and additional efforts may be needed to support these vulnerable youth. School club participation may represent an opportunity to modify maltreated youth's risk for school dropout. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The indigenous people have been identified to be among the poorest and the most socioeconomically and culturally marginalized people all over the world. The main purpose of the paper is to explore the socioeconomic and demographic factors of indigenous people in Peninsular Malaysia in context of poverty and the role of income dependency of non-timber forest products (NTFP). The data were collected in 2014 and 2015 through primary and secondary sources. Partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analysis the data. PLS is a modeling technique that features multiple regression and principal component analysis. The study shows that still a large number of indigenous households is involved in the NTFP activities. But the communities are moving away from NTFP based income to cash-crop based income because of poor sustainable forest management and lack of forest property rights. However, NTFP have a significant role in the household income and contribute 24% of the average income. Moreover, the analysis shows that location is significant to the poverty. There should be a suitable sustainable forest management system which can teach these indigenous communities about proper way of NTFP gathering and given proper rights to forest land. Furthermore, education is not significant to indigenous people and there is a high rate of school dropout among them. The government should introduce a different education system for indigenous communities which will emphasize the importance of education to them. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Secondary education among lower caste adolescent girls living in rural Karnataka, South India, is characterized by high rates of school drop-out and absenteeism. A cross-sectional baseline survey (N=2275) was conducted in 2014 as part of a cluster-randomized control trial among adolescent girls (13-14 year) and their families from marginalized communities in two districts of north Karnataka. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used. Overall, 8.7% girls reported secondary school dropout and 8.1% reported frequent absenteeism (past month). In adjusted analyses, economic factors (household poverty; girls' work-related migration), social norms and practices (child marriage; value of girls' education), and school-related factors (poor learning environment and bullying/harassment at school) were associated with an increased odds of school dropout and absenteeism. Interventions aiming to increase secondary school retention among marginalized girls may require a multi-level approach, with synergistic components that address social, structural and economic determinants of school absenteeism and dropout. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Background: In the United States, perceptions of marijuana’s acceptability are at an all-time high, risk perceptions among youth are low, and rates are rising among Black youth. Thus, it is imperative to increase the understanding of long-term effects of adolescent marijuana use and ways to mitigate adverse consequences. Objectives: To identify the midlife consequences of heavy adolescent marijuana use and the mechanisms driving effects among a Black, urban population. Methods: This study analyzed the propensity score-matched prospective data from the Woodlawn Study, a community cohort study of urban Black youth followed from ages 6–42. After matching the 165 adolescents who used marijuana heavily to 165 non-heavy/nonusers on background confounders to reduce selection effects (64.5% male), we tested the association of heavy marijuana use by age 16 with social, economic, and physical and psychological health outcomes in midlife and the ability of adult drug trajectories (marijuana, cocaine, and heroin use from ages 17–42) and school dropout to mediate effects. Results: Heavy adolescent marijuana use was associated with an increased risk of being poor and of being unmarried in midlife. Marijuana use also predicted lower income and greater anxious mood in midlife. Both adult drug use trajectories and school dropout significantly mediated socioeconomic effects but not marital or anxious mood outcomes. Conclusion: Heavy adolescent marijuana use seems to set Black, urban youth on a long-term trajectory of disadvantage that persists into midlife. It is critical to interrupt this long-term disadvantage through the prevention of heavy adolescent marijuana use, long-term marijuana and other drug use, and school dropout. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Despite increasing global attention and commitments by countries to end the harmful practice of child marriage, each year some 15 million girls marry before the age of 18. The preponderance of the evidence produced historically on child marriage comes from South Asia, where the vast majority of child brides live. Far less attention has been paid to child marriage in sub-Saharan Africa, where prevalence rates remain high. The International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) recently conducted research in Kenya, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia to contribute to greater understanding of the drivers of child marriage in each of these contexts. Synthesizing findings from 4 diverse countries provides a useful opportunity to identify similarities and differences, as well as understandings that may be applicable to and helpful for preventing child marriage across these and other settings. Across the 4 countries, ICRW's research echoes the existing literature base in affirming that child marriage is rooted in inequitable gender norms that prioritize women's roles as wives, mothers, and household caretakers, resulting in inadequate investments by families in girls’ education. These discriminatory norms interact closely with poverty and a lack of employment opportunities for girls and young women to perpetuate marriage as a seemingly viable alternative for girls. We found in the African study sites that sexual relations, unplanned pregnancy, and school dropout often precede child marriage, which differs from much of the existing evidence on child marriage from South Asia. Further, unlike in South Asia, where family members typically determine the spouse a girl will marry, most girls in the Africa study settings have greater autonomy in partner choice selection. In Senegal, increasing educational attainment and labor migration, particularly by young women, has contributed to reduced rates of child marriage for girls. Our findings suggest that improving gender equitable norms and providing more—and more equitable—opportunities for girls, particularly with regard to education and employment, are likely to improve child marriage outcomes. Providing comprehensive sexuality education and youth-friendly reproductive health services can reduce rates of early pregnancy that contribute to child marriage. Finally, identifying ways in which to improve communication between parents and adolescent daughters could go far in ensuring that girls feel valued and that parents feel heard as they make decisions together regarding the lives and opportunities of these adolescent girls. © 2017 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai},

abstract={Background: In most Western countries, the individual, social, and family characteristics associated with students’ dropout in the general population are well documented. Yet, there is a lack of large-scale studies to establish whether these characteristics have the same influence for students with an immigrant background. Aims: The first aim of this study was to assess the differences between first-, second-, and third-generation-plus students in terms of the individual, social, and family factors associated with school dropout. Next, we examined the differential associations between these individual, social, and family factors and high school dropout as a function of students’ immigration status. Sample: Participants were 2291 students (54.7% with an immigrant background) from ten low-SES schools in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). Method: Individual, social, and family predictors were self-reported by students in secondary one (mean age = 12.34 years), while school dropout status was obtained five or 6 years after students were expected to graduate. Results: Results of logistic regressions with multiple group latent class models showed that first- and second-generation students faced more economic adversity than third-generation-plus students and that they differed from each other and with their native peers in terms of individual, social, and family risk factors. Moreover, 40% of the risk factors considered in this study were differentially associated with first-, second-, and third-generation-plus students’ failure to graduate from high school. Conclusion: These results provide insights on immigrant and non-immigrant inner cities’ students experiences related to school dropout. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2017 The British Psychological Society},

abstract={The status quo of Roma communities in Europe is strongly marked by marginalisation and discrimination. Roma people tend to face social exclusion and segregation leading to lack of education, chronic unemployment and limited access to healthcare, housing and public services as well as widespread poverty. Very few studies have been conducted as far as Roma community in Cyprus are concerned and almost none has explored quality of life of this ethnic minority. Therefore, this article examines quality of life dimensions in approximately half of the population (n = 156) residing in the catchment area. Both quantitative and qualitative results showed poor standards of living, high school dropout rates and high levels of marginalisation. Social work as discipline can foster a more empowering and coordinating role as to enhance Roma’s distinctive identity and improve standards of living. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This study examined prospective associations between poverty, gender, and school dropout in a large community sample of South African adolescents (baseline: n = 3515, follow-up: n = 3401, 57% female, age range at baseline: 10–17 years, mean age at baseline = 13.45). School dropout was defined as being enrolled in school at baseline assessment but no longer enrolled in school at follow-up assessment. Poverty was measured at baseline assessment using an index of access to the eight highest socially perceived necessities for South African children and adolescents. Demographic characteristics including child gender and age, province, and urban versus rural location were recorded at baseline assessment and controlled for in the analysis. As predicted, higher poverty scores (AOR = 2.01, p <.001) were associated with increased odds of school dropout 1 year later. Gender was not a significant predictor of school dropout (AOR = 1.56, p =.07) but did interact with poverty (AOR = 0.66, p =.04) in predicting school dropout. However, our initial hypothesis that the impact of poverty on school dropout would be stronger for girls than boys was not supported. Instead, results indicated that while girls were at elevated risk of school dropout at low and mean levels of poverty, at high levels of poverty this gender difference was no longer evident. Findings suggest that vulnerable boys should not be neglected in policies to improve retention in education in contexts of extreme poverty. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article describes the experience of the MEF’s impact evaluation management as one of the RBB instruments and documents the design and results obtained from three impact evaluations of the most emblematic government social programs. The Service of Visiting Families (SAF) of the National Program “Cuna Mas”, conditional cash transfer Program “JUNTOS” and National Program “Pension 65” focusing on objective population’s health the outcomes. Among the main results, it was found the SAF generated improvements in cognitive and communication development in children, but had no impact on mothers’ child care practices or children’s nutritional status. In the case of JUNTOS, there were increases in per capita spending, food expenditure, decreases in severity and poverty gap, increases in school attendance and reductions of school dropout. However, no significant results were found in most indicators of prenatal health, child health, or chronic malnutrition. In the case of Pension 65, there were increases in household consumption and improvements in elderly’s emotional health (depression, self valoration); but there was no evidence of increases in the use of health services by the elderly or improvements in their physical health. Therefore, it is recommended that such programs boost their designs and inter-sectoral coordination with MINSA and subnational institutions, in order to improve contents of healthy practices and child care, and optimize the provision of health and education services, in order to meet the demands of their users. © 2017, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

abstract={Aim: Early engagement in care is thought to reduce disabling social losses related to the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), such as school dropout, homelessness, and incarceration, which contribute to chronic disability. Early-intervention services that promote recovery will not be effective if eligible persons drop out of treatment after an initial hospitalization for a psychotic disorder. We had the unique opportunity to examine the treatment disengagement rate of patients with early psychosis after an initial hospitalization. Methods: In a predominantly male, African-American, and socioeconomically disadvantaged group of 33 participants with first-episode psychosis assessed at initial hospitalization and six months after discharge, we compared clinical characteristics (medication adherence attitudes and behaviors, knowledge about schizophrenia, insight, symptom severity, and persistence of alcohol and drug use) among those who disengaged and people who engaged in care. Results: More than half (18, 54.5%) attended <3 outpatient appointments in the six months after hospital discharge and, of those, nearly all (15, 83.3%) attended no outpatient appointments. Disengaged people were much less adherent to medications in the past month and six months, and scored lower on medication adherence attitudes, knowledge about psychosis, and insight. They had greater positive symptom severity and a higher likelihood of continuing drug use. Clinical Relevancy: Initial treatment disengagement is very common among young people with first-episode psychosis and is associated with poorer clinical status. More research is needed on the causes of disengagement during this critical period and ways to improve initial treatment engagement among people with first-episode psychosis.},

abstract={Importance Adequate management of menstrual hygiene is taken for granted in affluent countries; however, inadequate menstrual hygiene is a major problem for girls and women in resource-poor countries, which adversely affects the health and development of adolescent girls. Objective The aim of this article is to review the current evidence concerning menstrual hygiene management in these settings. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed search using MeSH terms was conducted in English, supplemented by hand searching for additional references. Retrieved articles were reviewed, synthesized, and summarized. Results Most research to date has described menstrual hygiene knowledge, attitudes, and practices, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Many school-based studies indicate poorer menstrual hygiene among girls in rural areas and those attending public schools. The few studies that have tried to improve or change menstrual hygiene practices provide moderate to strong evidence that targeted interventions do improve menstrual hygiene knowledge and awareness. Conclusion and Relevance Challenges to improving menstrual hygiene management include lack of support from teachers (who are frequently male); teasing by peers when accidental menstrual soiling of clothes occurs; poor familial support; lack of cultural acceptance of alternative menstrual products; limited economic resources to purchase supplies; inadequate water and sanitation facilities at school; menstrual cramps, pain, and discomfort; and lengthy travel to and from school, which increases the likelihood of leaks/stains. Areas for future research include the relationship between menarche and school dropout, the relationship between menstrual hygiene management and other health outcomes, and how to increase awareness of menstrual hygiene management among household decision makers including husbands/fathers and in-laws. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician/gynecologist should be able to define what is meant by "adequate menstrual hygiene management," identify the challenges to adequate menstrual hygiene management that exist in resource-poor countries, and describe some of the intervention strategies that have been proposed to improve menstrual hygiene management for girls and women in those countries. © 2017 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

abstract={Aims To explore and describe perceptions and experiences of living with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus among children/youths in Tajikistan. Methods Qualitative methods were employed. Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball samplings. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide with children/youths having diabetes, their parents as well as health professionals. Data were analyzed according to Malterud's systematic text condensation. Results Children/youths with diabetes (n = 18), their parents (n = 19) and endocrinologists (n = 4) were interviewed. Families described unique stories in which "emotional stress" and a spiritual "evil eye" were perceived as possible causes of diabetes. Life-threatening complications and maltreatment preceding diagnosis of diabetes were frequent. From manifestation of diabetes onwards, families struggled with systemic and cultural obstacles, causing stigma, discrimination, high school-drop-out rates, diabetic coma, chronic complications or death of the child/youth with diabetes. Conclusions Results of this qualitative study highlight the severity and complexity of challenges families living with a child/youth having diabetes in this low-income country face. Efforts to improve life expectancy and life quality are strongly needed and require addressing both systemic and cultural factors in order to accomplish sustainable impact. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Purpose. To evaluate the effect of behavioral, empowerment-focused interventions on the incidence of pregnancy-related school dropout among girls in Nairobi’s informal settlements. Method. Retrospective data on pregnancy-related school dropout from two cohorts were analyzed using a matched-pairs quasi-experimental design. The primary outcome was the change in the number of school dropouts due to pregnancy from 1 year before to 1 year after the interventions. Results. Annual incidence of school dropout due to pregnancy decreased by 46% in the intervention schools (from 3.9% at baseline to 2.1% at follow-up), whereas the comparison schools remained essentially unchanged (p <.029). Sensitivity analysis shows that the findings are robust to small levels of unobserved bias. Conclusions. Results suggest that these behavioral interventions significantly reduced the number of school dropouts due to pregnancy. As there are limited promising studies on behavioral interventions that decrease adolescent pregnancy in low-income settings, this intervention may be an important addition to this toolkit. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Public Health Education.},

abstract={Using an ecological model, we describe substance use and sexual risk behaviors of young male laborers at a roadside market in Malawi. Data included observations and interviews with 18 key market leaders and 15 laborers (ages 18-25 years). Alcohol, marijuana, and commercial sex workers (CSWs) were widely available. We identified three patterns of substance use: 6 young men currently used, 6 formerly used, and 3 never used. Substance use was linked to risky sex, including sex with CSWs. The market supported risky behaviors through availability of resources; supportive norms, including beliefs that substance use enhanced strength; and lack of restraints. Community-level poverty, cultural support for alcohol, interpersonal family/peer influences, early substance use, and school dropout also contributed to risky behaviors. Parental guidance was protective but not often reported. Local programs addressing substance use and risky sex simultaneously and better national substance use policies and mental health services are needed. © 2015 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care},

abstract={There are tensions within formal education between imparting knowledge and the development of skills for handling that knowledge. In the primary school sector, the latter can also be squeezed out of the curriculum by a focus on basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. What happens when an explicit attempt is made to develop young children's reasoning—both in terms of their apparent cognitive abilities and their basic skills? This paper reports an independent evaluation of an in-class intervention called ‘Philosophy for Children’ (P4C), after just over one year of schooling. The intervention aims to help children become more willing and able to question, reason, construct arguments and collaborate with others. A group of 48 volunteer schools were randomised to receive P4C (22 schools) or act as a control for one year (26). This paper reports the CAT results for all pupils in years 4 and 5 initially, and the Key Stage 2 attainment in English and Maths for those starting in year 5. There was no school dropout. Individual attrition from a total of 3,159 pupils was around 11 percent—roughly equal between groups. There were small positive ‘effect’ sizes in favour of the P4C group in progress in reading (+0.12) and maths (+0.10), and even smaller perhaps negligible improvements in CAT scores (+0.07) and writing (+0.03). The results for the most disadvantaged (free school eligible) pupils were larger for attainment (+0.29 in reading, +0.17 writing and +0.20 maths), but not for CATs (–0.02). Observations and interviews suggest that the intervention was generally enjoyable and thought to be beneficial for pupil confidence. Our conclusion is that, for those wishing to improve attainment outcomes in the short term, an emphasis on developing reasoning is promising, especially for the poorest students, but perhaps not the most effective way forward. However, for those who value reasoning for its own sake, this evaluation demonstrates that using curriculum time in this way does not damage attainment (and may well enhance it and reduce the poverty gradient in attainment), and so suggests that something like P4C is an appropriate educational approach. © 2016 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.},

abstract={As populations migrate and seek refuge around the world, educators in receiving countries need information about how to provide meaningful education experiences. Refugee children have higher rates of school dropout and are faced with many challenges, such as acculturation stress, poverty, poor housing, dangerous neighborhoods, and psychological disorders. The purpose of this article is to examine the research and current status of U.S. school system supports for the education of refugee children and to provide suggestions based on evidence-based practice for refugee children's success. The authors provide a historical overview of policies and provisions of refugee education, an assessment of multiple factors affecting refugee children's adjustment and success at school, and a review of evidence-based practice for refugee children. ©, Copyright Association for Childhood Education International.},

abstract={According to WHO, adolescence extends from ages 10 to 19. Adolescent pregnancies are mostly unplanned, with 16 million live births and five millions abortions a year worldwide. Ninety-five percent teenage pregnancies occur in poor countries, mainly in Africa. The USA shows the highest adolescent pregnancy rate in Western countries. 207,000 live births and 160,000 abortions occurred in EU teens in 2011. Low income family, low education, unemployment, disadvantaged neighborhood, poor school results, belonging to ethnic minorities, mental deficits promote teen pregnancy, with the bigger risks because of the lower socioeconomic level. The younger the girl, the worse the outcomes, with preterm delivery, preeclampsia, eclampsia, urinary infections, anemia, depression, school abandonment, unqualified jobs, social security needs, and early death. Newborns risk low birth weight, infections, IUGR, SIDS, and death. Typical teen risk factors are: still ongoing growth, still developing genitalia, low BMI, short cervix, inadequate pelvis, low central body fat, genital infections, stress, depression, poverty, black race, insufficient prenatal cares, smoking, alcohol, substance abuse, school dropout, sexual promiscuity, sexual abuse, and poor support. Still growing mothers and fetuses compete for nutrients with high maternal weight gain and low neonatal birth weight. Pregnant teens require close follow-up, adequate weight gain, possible cervical cerclage, screening of both STDs and sexual abuse, and psychosocial support. During labor, slow progression, dystocias, and neonatal complications often occur, so teens should deliver in high level hospitals. After delivery, promotion of breastfeeding, screening of depression, prevention of repeated pregnancy are mandatory. Specific features and proper management of adolescent pregnancy are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={The present chapter explores the current social and educational reality of the Roma population, an ethnic minority that has historically experienced, and still experiences, high levels of poverty, marginalization, and discrimination in society1. The present analysis focuses on their relationship with the school as an institution in order to explain what factors are the causes of their elevated academic failure and dropout rates. As such, several programs are detailed in order to provide examples of good practices that have been successfully carried out recently in different countries of Europe and have greatly improved both the access to education and the academic performance of Roma youngsters. This research has led to the conclusion that a number of actions must be taken including; fostering educational models focused on awareness and respect for diversity, addressing the poor performance and achievement from a multilevel approach with the entire society's support, and encouraging a constructive dialogue between all socioeducational agents and the Roma community in order for them to gain more relevance in their own learning processes. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Rationale: Prior researchers found that individual-level environmental and social indicators did not explain the racial disparity in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables, as well as risk factors for a range of adverse behavioral and health outcomes, may better explain this racial disparity and help identify modifiable intervention targets. Objectives: To evaluate the associations of neighborhood socioeconomic variables with obstructive sleep apnea severity and to assess whether the neighborhood variables explain the association between race and obstructive sleep apnea severity. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data of 774 children in six cities who participated in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial. The outcome variable was the apnea- hypopnea index (AHI). Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained on the basis of the children's residential addresses and information in the American Community Survey. Regression models were used to assess the associations among neighborhood conditions, race, and AHI. Measurements and Main Results: Higher poverty rate and percentage of single-female-headed households were associated with higher AHI (P = 0.008 and 0.002, respectively). African American race was associated with a 1.33 (1.08-1.64 95% confidence interval)- fold increase in AHI, adjusting for age and sex. After controlling for poverty rate or percentage of single-female-headed households with children, the association between race and AHI levels was no longer significant (P = 0.15 and 0.26, respectively), and the magnitude of race association decreased 34 or 55%, suggesting that the association between race and AHI levels was largely explained by poverty rate or percentage of single-female-headed households with children. Conclusions: Neighborhood socioeconomic variables in comparison with individual-level socioeconomic indicators provides better explanations for the racial disparity in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Further research aimed at identifying factors that aggregate in disadvantaged neighborhoods and increase sleep apnea risk may suggest modifiable intervention targets.

abstract={Background: Adolescent pregnancies pose a risk to the young mothers and their babies. In Zambia, 35% of young girls in rural areas have given birth by the age of 18 years. Pregnancy rates are particularly high among out-of-school girls. Poverty, low enrolment in secondary school, myths and community norms all contribute to early childbearing. This protocol describes a trial aiming to measure the effect on early childbearing rates in a rural Zambian context of (1) economic support to girls and their families, and (2) combining economic support with a community intervention to enhance knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and supportive community norms. Methods/design: This cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) will have three arms. The clusters are rural schools with surrounding communities. Approximately 4900 girls in grade 7 in 2016 will be recruited from 157 schools in 12 districts. In one intervention arm, participating girls and their guardians will be offered cash transfers and payment of school fees. In the second intervention arm, there will be both economic support and a community intervention. The interventions will be implemented for approximately 2 years. The final survey will be 4.5 years after recruitment. The primary outcomes will beincidence of births within 8 months of the end of the intervention perio,incidence of births before girls' 18th birthda andproportion of girls who sit for the grade 9 exa. Final survey interviewers will be unaware of the intervention status of respondents. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat and adjusted for cluster design and confounders. Qualitative process evaluation will be conducted. Discussion: This is the first CRCT to measure the effect of combining economic support with a community intervention to prevent adolescent childbearing in a low- or middle-income country. We have designed a programme that will be sustainable and feasible to scale up. The findings will be relevant for programmes for adolescent reproductive health in Zambia and similar contexts.

abstract={Background Poor menstrual knowledge and access to sanitary products have been proposed as barriers to menstrual health and school attendance. In response, interventions targeting these needs have seen increasing implementation in public and private sectors. However, there has been limited assessment of their effectiveness. Objectives Assess the impact of providing reusable sanitary pads and puberty education on girls' school attendance and psychosocial wellbeing outcomes. Methods A cluster quasi-randomised controlled trial was conducted across 8 schools, including 1124 girls, in rural Uganda. Schools were allocated to one of four conditions: the provision of puberty education alone; reusable sanitary pads alone; puberty education and reusable sanitary pads; and a control (no intervention). The primary outcome was school attendance. Secondary outcomes reflected psychosocial wellbeing. Results At follow-up, school attendance had worsened for girls across all conditions. Per-protocol analysis revealed that this decline was significantly greater for those in the control condition d = 0.52 (95%CI 0.26-0.77), with those in control schools having a 17.1% (95%CI: 8.7-25.5) greater drop in attendance than those in any intervention school. There were no differences between the intervention conditions. High rates of school drop-out and transfer meant the trial suffered from substantial participant drop-out. Intention-to-treat analyses using two different imputation strategies were consistent with the main results, with mean differences of 5.2% attendance in best-case and 24.5% in worst-case imputations. Results were robust to adjustments for clustering. There was no impact of the interventions on girls' self-reported shame or insecurity during menstruation. Conclusion Results of the trial support the hypothesised positive impact of providing sanitary pads or puberty education for girls' school attendance in a developing country context. Findings must be interpreted with caution in light of poor participant retention, intervention fidelity, and the attendance measures used. © 2016 Montgomery et al.

abstract={Introduction School dropout in adolescents can have negative consequences, not only for the individual and the family, but also for the society. To identify the characteristics associated with the occurrence of this event might contribute to the planning of a prevention strategy. Objectives To evaluate the relationship between the individual and home characteristics and school dropout in adolescents from 12 to 17 years old in Colombia. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted from information taken from the results obtained in the 2015 National Mental Health Survey. A study was made of the relationship between the individual and home characteristics and school dropout in adolescents from 12 to 17 years old Results A higher percentage of school dropouts was found in the older adolescents, females, and those who have children. Among the home characteristics, it was observed that those homes with more than two people, located in rural area, or that are classified as poor, have an increased percentage of school dropout adolescents. Conclusions Strategies for which the main goal is to prevent school dropout should consider populations with higher prevalence of out-of-school adolescents (female, homes in rural area, or household poverty). Preventive actions of adolescent pregnancy might contribute to reduce the school dropout rate. © 2016 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría},

abstract={The school dropout is a not negligible phenomenon that, if not effectively contrasted, puts at risk the future of young people and expose them to greater risks of unemployement, poverty and social exclusion compared to peers with a good instruction level. In this paper we present AYO!, an extracurricolar laboratory aimed to contrast the high school dropout. AYO! is an acronym that means Assemble Your Objects, and it was choosen, in addition to literal meaning, for the assonance with the dialectal Sardinian's expression Ajo!, which is an exhortation that can be translated into english in 'come on!' or 'get a move on!'. AYO! allows engagement of students in design, realization and use of sensors and actuators systems with the aim of monitoring and analyzing the ambient around them. The practical activities have allowed to provide knowledge about very interesting topics for labour market and to develop awareness of how technological innovation can be used to understand the phenomena that surround them (eg. pollution, energy consumption, etc.). Specifically, the laboratory focuses on the paradigm of the Internet of Things which constitutes a key topic from the point of view of today scientific research and business strategies. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider extreme household poverty to be a risk factor in youth poverty in Mongolia, one of the 50 poorest countries in the world. The emphasis is placed on the identification of poverty trap mechanisms generated through selective access to education. We use a unique, nationally representative School-to-Work Transition survey. A young person born in a household living on US$1 a day has a ceteris paribus probability of school dropout that is four times higher than a contemporary born into a family living on more than $3 a day. Parental educational background is a good proxy of household poverty. Fairlie decomposition suggests that differences in characteristics expound only one-third of the gap. School dropout results in twice the probability of working poverty. It reduces the chances of women being employed and increases those of men, as women drop out of school to attend to domestic chores, while men pursue child labour in herding. © 2016 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

abstract={Parental separation is linked to multiple negative outcomes for children in all spheres of life. A field study was designed to estimate the epidemiology and to quantify the outcomes on the wellbeing of children from separated parents. Thus, data on socio-economic status, psychological adjustment, behavioral disorders, social relations, self-concept, and academic achievement were gathered from 346 children and adolescents, 173 separated parents, and 173 parents from intact families in the paediatric catchment area of Galicia (Spain). The results showed that parental separation had a significant negative impact on the children's and adolescents' family income (increasing the probability of falling below the poverty line); psychological adjustment (i.e., higher scores in anxiety, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation, and interpersonal alienation); social relations (i.e., less self-control in social relations; higher social withdrawal); self-concept (lower levels of academic, emotional, physical, and family self-concept), and academic achievement (lower academic achievement with higher school dropout rates). Moreover, children from separated families had a higher probability of being exposed to gender violence. Epidemiologically, parental separation is associated to the probability of falling below the poverty line 33.9%; being exposed to gender violence 43.2%; and symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation interpersonal alienation, and social withdrawal, i.e., 20, 17, 27, 20, 19, and 35.5%, respectively. Inversely, self-control in social relations, and academic, emotional, physical, and family self-concept fell to 16, 32, 27, 22, and 37%, respectively. The interrelationship among these variables and the implications of these results for interventions are discussed. © 2016 Seijo, Fariña, Corras, Novo and Arce.},

abstract={This empirical note seeks to provide preliminary insights into factors that may have influenced the high school dropout rate in the US cities. For some 300-plus cities for the year 2011, OLS estimates reveal that the dropout rate is a decreasing function of both the per cent of the population that is Hispanic and per pupil public education spending at the elementary and secondary levels. In addition, the estimates find that the dropout rate is an increasing function of the per cent of the population that consisted of families with children and that was classified as being at or below the poverty level and the per cent of the population aged 25 years and older that did not have a high school diploma. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Background The first policy action outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the implementation of national social protection systems. This study assesses whether social protection provision can impact 17 indicators of five key health-related SDG goals amongst adolescents in South Africa. Methods We conducted a longitudinal survey of adolescents (10±18 years) between 2009 and 2012. Census areas were randomly selected in two urban and two rural health districts in two South African provinces, including all homes with a resident adolescent. Household receipt of social protection in the form of 'cash' (economic provision) and 'care' (psychosocial support) social protection, and health-related indicators within five SDG goals were assessed. Gender-disaggregated analyses included multivariate logistic regression, testing for interactions between social protection and socio-demographic covariates, and marginal effects models. Findings Social protection was associated with significant adolescent risk reductions in 12 of 17 gender- disaggregated SDG indicators, spanning SDG 2 (hunger); SDG 3 (AIDS, tuberculosis, mental health and substance abuse); SDG 4 (educational access); SDG 5 (sexual exploitation, sexual and reproductive health); and SDG 16 (violence perpetration). For six of 17 indicators, combined cash plus care showed enhanced risk reduction effects. Two interactions showed that effects of care varied by poverty level for boys' hunger and girls' school dropout. For tuberculosis, and for boys' sexual exploitation and girls' mental health and violence perpetration, no effects were found and more targeted or creative means will be needed to reach adolescents on these challenging burdens. Interpretation National social protection systems are not a panacea, but findings suggest that they have multiple and synergistic positive associations with adolescent health outcomes. Such systems may help us rise to the challenges of health and sustainable development. © 2016 Cluver et al.

abstract={Background: Teenage pregnancy still remains high in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), as well as in high-income countries (HIC). It is a major contributor to maternal and child morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, it has social consequences, such as perpetuating the cycle of poverty including early school dropout by the pregnant adolescent, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Few studies in SSA have investigated the trends in teenage pregnancy and the associated factors, while this is critical in fully understanding teenage pregnancy and for promotion of reproductive health among adolescents at large in SSA. Methods: To examine the trends in teenage pregnancy and to identify associations with other health risk behaviours in South Africa (SA), a total of 31 816 South African school-going adolescents between 11 to 19 years of age were interviewed in three cross-sectional surveys. Data from the first (2002, n = 10 549), second (2008, n = 10 270) and the third (2011, n = 10 997) nationally representative South African youth risk behaviour surveys (YRBS) were used for this study. Results: The overall prevalence of having ever been pregnant among the combined 3-survey sample was self-reported to be 11.0 % and stable across the three surveys. Sexual intercourse among adolescents in SA has decreased from 41.9 % in 2002 to 36.9 % in 2011. However, pregnancy among girls who ever had sex increased from 17.3 % (95 % CI: 0.16-0.19) in 2002, to 23.6 % (95 % CI: 0.21-0.26) in 2008 and decreased to 21.3 % (95 % CI: 0.19-0.23) in 2011. The odds for ever been pregnant were higher for girls who had 2 or more sexual partners (OR: 1.250, 95 % CI: 1.039-1.503), girls who ever used alcohol before sex (OR: 1.373, 95 % CI: 1.004-1.878), practised binge-drinking during the last month (OR: 0.624, 95 % CI: 0.503-0.774), and girls who used mandrax (OR: 1.968, 95 % CI: 1,243-3.117). The odds for never been pregnant were lower for those who used condoms (OR: 0.462, 95 % CI: 0.309-0.691). Conclusions: Girls continue to become pregnant at unacceptably high rates in SA. Sexual intercourse among adolescents in SA has decreased slightly. However, among those who are sexually active pregnancy prevalence rates have increased. More over, this is in the context of high prevalence of HIV and other STI. There is a need to address adolescents' sexual and reproductive health, and several health risk behaviours, including substance use, that are associated with teenage pregnancy in SA. © 2016 Jonas et al.},

abstract={This study evaluates the Youth Development Program (YDP), a component of the federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA). We examine whether the YDP reduced dropout rates among youth in secondary schools in seven school districts in the impoverished Mississippi River Delta in southeast Arkansas. Initially, the program seems to have an impact. Students who participate in the program are less likely to drop out of school than students in a comparison group. However, when other factors are taken into consideration, such as whether the student was “over-age” for their grade (and thus likely had been “held back”), the effect that program participation had on the likelihood of dropping out disappears. In short, we find that when controlling for other factors, no statistically significant relationship exists between program participation and dropout rates. We discuss the implications of the WIA’s YDP failure and school retention programs, more broadly. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={In this article, we review the evidence on the effects of poverty and low income on children's development and well-being. We argue that poverty is an important indicator of societal and child well-being, but that poverty is more than just an indicator. Poverty and low income are causally related to worse child development outcomes, particularly cognitive developmental and educational outcomes. Mechanisms through which poverty affects these outcomes include material hardship, family stress, parental and cognitive inputs, and the developmental context to which children are exposed. The timing, duration, and community context of poverty also appear to matter for children's outcomes - with early experiences of poverty, longer durations of poverty, and higher concentrations of poverty in the community leading to worse child outcomes. © 2016 Academic Pediatric Association.},

abstract={Context Medication drug exposures among young children continue to rise despite current poison prevention efforts. These exposures result in increased healthcare utilization and medical costs. New tactics are needed to reduce injuries related to pediatric drug exposures. Objective We aimed to identify cluster patterns in: (1) calls for pediatric medication drug exposures and (2) a subset of calls that resulted in medical evaluation referrals. We identified and evaluated population characteristics associated with cluster patterns. Methods We analyzed 26 685 pharmaceutical drug exposures involving children <5 years of age based on calls reported to the Pittsburgh Poison Center from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. We performed spatial statistics to assess for clustering. We used logistic regression to estimate population characteristics associated with clustering. Results Spatial analysis identified 22 exposure clusters and five referral clusters. Sixty-five percent of 89 ZIP codes in the clusters of drug exposure with healthcare facility (HCF) referral were not identified in the exposure clusters. ZIP codes in the HCF referral clusters were characterized as rural, impoverished, and with high rates of unemployment and school dropouts. Discussion Our principal findings demonstrate pediatric drug exposures do exist in discrete geographic clusters and with distinct socioeconomic characteristics. Conclusion This study offers a starting point for subsequent investigations into the geographic and social context of pediatric medication drug exposures. This is an important step in revising pediatric poison prevention strategies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Dropout school/university is a phenomenon with major implications for formal education. A number of factors such as poverty, family breakdown, quality of life, subculture groups, ethnic traditions, etc. are causes of dropout, claiming these remedial solutions. Support programs have not been effective since they contributed only little to reduce school dropout. The study we propose reveals a set of causes and proposes new strategies, applying their lead to equalization of opportunities for access to school education / university. © SGEM2016.},

abstract={The combined area of the Arab countries reaches about 13.3 million square meters, representing about 9.6% of the world’s area. The number of the Arab world population reaches about 370 million people, representing about 5.2% of the total world population. In addition, the workforce reaches about 130 million workers (in 2012) and the rate of unemployment reaches about 17.4%. Rural development processes face many economic, social and environmental problems, which may constitute an obstacle before them. These problems include the problem of population and illiteracy, as illiteracy rate in the Arab world was estimated at about 25.5% as an average at the period (2005-2010), and education dropout. In addition, the problem of unemployment, as the volume of unemployment in the Arab countries as a whole reached about 18.1 million unemployed persons in 2013, poverty, and slowdown of the agricultural development rates and the multiplicity of the problems facing the Arab agricultural investment. The study aims to identify the problems that face the rural development in the Arab community and the ways to face them. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As an alternative to traditional public housing programs, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program has been the dominant federal affordable housing program in the US. However, we have empirically limited understanding as to whether the LIHTC program promotes locational options that offer better socioeconomic opportunities for low-income families. This paper examines the relationships between the spatial location of public housing and LIHTC households and sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods in Austin, Texas. We find that both public housing and LIHTC households are located in disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially in terms of higher minority populations, poverty, unemployment, female-headed family, welfare receipt, teenage school dropouts, and lower income. Furthermore, our study shows that the location of public housing and LIHTC households is associated with concentrated crime. However, after accounting for the geographic and sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods, only neighborhoods where LIHTC households are located are significantly related to concentrated crime incidents. © 2015 Community Development Society.},

abstract={Reducing the number of early school leavers, those who quit education without at least a high school degree, is a key objective of educational policy throughout Europe. Previous research has shown that in particular youngsters from disadvantaged families face relatively high risks of school dropout. In this paper we use data from the 2009 ad hoc module of the Labour Force Survey to examine how macro-level determinants influence school dropout risks among different social groups. Our results indicate that both the design of the educational system (tracking age, extent of vocational education) and characteristics of the socioeconomic context (poverty rate, unemployment patterns) have an impact on the social distribution of school dropout risk. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Education is an effective way to improve girls' self-worth, health, and productivity; however there remains a gender gap between girls' and boys' completion of school. The literature around factors influencing girls' decision to stay in school is limited. Seven focus group discussions took place among 79 girls in forms 2 to 4 at secondary schools in rural western Kenya, to examine their views on why girls absent themselves or dropout from school. Data were analysed thematically. Lack of resources, sexual relationships with boyfriends, and menstrual care problems were reported to lead directly to dropout or school absence. These were tied to girls increased vulnerability to pregnancy, poor performance in school, and punishments, which further increase school absence and risk of dropout. Poverty, unmet essential needs, coercive sexual relationships, and an inequitable school environment collude to counter girls' resolve to complete their schooling. Lack of resources drive girls to have sex with boyfriends or men who provide them with essentials their family cannot afford, such as sanitary pads and transport to school. While these improve quality of their school life, this dynamic increases their exposure to sexual risk, pregnancy, punishment, and dropout. Evaluation of interventions to ameliorate these challenges is warranted, including provision of pocket money to address their needs. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract={Objective: To develop a method to assess long-term and recent progress for leading health indicators in Wisconsin. Methods: Data from state and national sources were compiled. Baseline (10-year) trends for 20 health indicators were measured and compared to the Healthy People 2020 improvement standard of 1% per year. Additionally, current rates were assessed by comparing the most recent year of data to the expected rate had the previous 10-year baseline trend continued. Where available, health indicator trends were reported by gender, race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic status. Results: Wisconsin improved on 10 of the 20 indicators over the past decade, with decreasing mortality rates for all age groups. The largest improvement was a decline of 3.0% per year in deaths among 1 to 24 year olds. The rates of teen births and adult excessive drinking also improved by 2.5% per year and 1.4% per year, respectively. Other indicators worsened. For example, increasing rates of low birthweight (+ 0.6% per year), adults in fair or poor health (+ 1.6% per year), and all socioeconomic indicators worsened (high school dropouts [+ 0.9% per year], unemployment [+ 5.9% per year], children in poverty [+ 5.1% per year], and violent crime [+ 2.3% per year]). Health indicators varied substantially across subgroups within Wisconsin. For example, African Americans were twice as likely to experience low birthweight compared to other racial subgroups, and males experienced death rates higher than females across all ages. Conclusion: Reporting current estimates and 10-year trends of leading health indicators helps identify areas of progress and opportunities for improvement. Despite progress in reducing death rates and several other health factors, self-reported health status is worsening in Wisconsin. Worsening socioeconomic conditions and health disparities represent significant public health challenges for Wisconsin’s future. © 2015 Wisconsin Medical Society.},

The lowest rates of primary school enrolment are at subsaharan Africa, Where only 65% of children attend school (UNESCO, 2014). To this situation, we have to add that one of every three girls leave education and doesn?t access to secondary school (Plan, 2012). Given this background, this research aims to explore the factors that contribute to the dropout of girls in primary education levels in central Kibosho (Tanzania). It has carried out a qualitative exploratory study which includes semi-structured interviews with 20 participants and focus groups with 12 teachers. The results show that the dropout of girls has various socioeconomic and gender factors such as poverty, lack of moral support, illiteracy of the parents, initiation rituals, early pregnancy, household chores, lack of resources and motivation of teachers in rural schools. Following the results, the paper presents a series of recommendations to both the government of Tanzania and the various educational agents to prevent dropout of girls and young women.},

abstract={Objective. We analyzed community area differences in teen births in Chicago, Illinois, from 1999 to 2009. We analyzed the association between changes in teen birth rates and concurrent measures of community area socioeconomic and demographic change. Methods. Mean annual changes in teen birth rates in 77 Chicago community areas were correlated with concurrent census-based population changes during the decade. Census measures included changes in race/ethnicity, adult high school dropouts, poverty or higher-income households, crowded housing, unemployment, English proficiency, foreign-born residents, or residents who moved in the last five years. We included non-collinear census measures with a p,0.1 bivariate association with change in teen births in a stepwise multiple linear regression model. Results. Teen birth rates in Chicago fell faster than the overall birth rates, from 85 births per 1,000 teens in 1999 to 57 births per 1,000 teens in 2009. There were strong positive associations between increases in the percentage of residents who were black and Hispanic, poor, without a high school diploma, and living in crowded housing, and a negative association with an increase in higher-income households. Population changes in poverty, Hispanic population, and high school dropouts were the only significant measures in the final model, explaining almost half of the variance in teen birth rate changes. Conclusion. The study provides a model of census-based measures that can be used to evaluate predicted vs. observed rates of change in teen births across communities, offering the potential to more appropriately prioritize public health resources for preventing unintended teen pregnancy. © 2015 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.},

abstract={Background: Poverty, family stability, and social policies influence the ability of adolescents to attend school. Likewise, being enrolled in school may shape an adolescent’s risk for HIV and pregnancy. We identified trends in school enrollment, factors predicting school enrollment (antecedents), and health risks associated with staying in or leaving school (consequences). Methods: Data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) were examined for adolescents 15–19 years (n = 21,735 person-rounds) from 1994 to 2013. Trends, antecedents, and consequences were assessed using logistic and linear regression with robust variance estimation. Qualitative data were used to explore school leaving among HIV+ and HIV− youths (15–24 years). Results: School enrollment and socioeconomic status (SES) rose steadily from 1994 to 2013 among adolescents; orphanhood declined after availability of antiretroviral therapy. Antecedent factors associated with school enrollment included age, SES, orphanhood, marriage, family size, and the percent of family members <20 years. In qualitative interviews, youths reported lack of money, death of parents, and pregnancy as primary reasons for school dropout. Among adolescents, consequences associated with school enrollment included lower HIV prevalence, prevalence of sexual experience, and rates of alcohol use and increases in consistent condom use. Young women in school were more likely to report use of modern contraception and never being pregnant. Young men in school reported fewer recent sexual partners and lower rates of sexual concurrency. Conclusions: Rising SES and declining orphanhood were associated with rising school enrollment in Rakai. Increasing school enrollment was associated with declining risk for HIV and pregnancy. © 2015, Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={There is widespread belief that dropping out of high school leads to economic hardship. This belief rests on tenuous evidence. High school dropouts likely face an increased risk of economic hardship because of differences beyond a high school diploma. In particular, dropouts are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds and thus face an elevated risk of economic hardship. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 Cohort, I estimate the consequences of dropping out by comparing dropouts to their siblings who completed high school. I also present OLS regression estimates using the same data. OLS regression estimates are consistently higher than sibling fixed effects estimates with the largest discrepancy occurring between estimates of the effect of dropping out on income-to-poverty ratio. However, the sibling fixed effect estimates reveal that dropping out has an effect on economic hardship net of unobserved background characteristics that are shared by siblings. I conclude with a discussion of how recent policy shifts affect the economic standing of low-ability students and suggest avenues for future research. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Minority children living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at high risk for school dropout, delinquency, and poor health, largely due to the negative impact of poverty and stress on parenting and child development. This study evaluated a population-level, family-centered, school-based intervention designed to promote learning, behavior, and health by strengthening parenting, classroom quality, and child self-regulation during early childhood. Ten schools in urban districts serving primarily low-income Black students were randomly assigned to intervention or a “pre-kindergarten education as usual” control condition. Intervention included a family program (a 13-week behavioral parenting intervention and concurrent group for children) and professional development for early childhood teachers. The majority (88 %) of the pre-kindergarten population (N = 1,050; age 4) enrolled in the trial, and nearly 60 % of parents in intervention schools participated in the family program. This study evaluated intervention impact on parenting (knowledge, positive behavior support, behavior management, involvement in early learning) and child conduct problems over a 2-year period (end of kindergarten). Intent-to-treat analyses found intervention effects on parenting knowledge, positive behavior support, and teacher-rated parent involvement. For the highest-risk families, intervention also resulted in increased parent-rated involvement in early learning and decreased harsh and inconsistent behavior management. Among boys at high risk for problems based on baseline behavioral dysregulation (age 4, 23 % of sample), intervention led to lower rates of conduct problems at age 6. Family-centered intervention at the transition to school has potential to improve population health and break the cycle of disadvantage for low-income, minority families. © 2014, Society for Prevention Research.},

abstract={In developing countries, seasonal labour migration from rural to urban or from backward to developed region is a household livelihood strategy to cope with poverty. In this process, the children of those migrants are the worst affected whether they accompany their parents or are left behind in the villages. The present paper explores the impact of temporary labour migration of parent(s) on school attendance of the children between 6-14 years and their dropping out from the school through an analysis of the cases from both the ends of migration stream in India. Data was collected from thirteen construction sites of Varanasi Uttar Pradesh and nine villages of Bihar by applying both qualitative and quantitative techniques. It is evident from the study that the migrants through remittances improve school accessibility for the left behind children and bridge gender gap in primary school education. However, among the accompanying migrant children of construction workers, many remain out of school and many are forced to drop out and some of them become vulnerable to work as child labour due to seasonal mobility of their parents. Thus, mainstreaming these children in development process is a big challenge in attaining the goal of universal primary education and inclusive growth in the country like India.},

abstract={This paper examines the relationship between national income and child labour in Ekiti municipality. Ekiti State is one of the six new states created on 1st October 1996 by the then Provisional Ruling Council. We are particularly interested in evaluating the economic role of children at different stages of development. Our objective is to estimate the effect of economic growth and development, as measured by per capita gross domestic product, on the incidence of child labour in Ekiti metropolis. A stratified random sampling method was carried out in 535 respondents who are found to be involved in child labour through interviews, issuance of questionnaires and focused group discussions. The data obtained from the field were analyzed using Regression analyses and Chi-square (X2) which was run on SPSS to test the level of significant difference. The analyses revealed that 46% child labour is currently practiced in Ekiti Municipality. We recognize the positive correlation between poverty, unemployment, school dropout and child labour. This indicates a negative effect on economic growth in Nigeria as the future of the country is at risk. Child labour may increase or decrease with income. We therefore recommend that government should undertake a mix of activities to raise awareness and combat child labour to tackle the problem of poverty and unemployment in Nigeria. © International Economic Society.},

abstract={In an increasingly global economy, and with retirement starting for the Baby Boomer generation, Congress has indicated a strong interest in ensuring that today's young people have the educational attainment and employment experience needed to become highly skilled workers, contributing taxpayers, and successful participants in civic life. Challenges in the economy and among certain youth populations, however, have heightened concern among policymakers that some young people may not be prepared to fill these roles. The employment levels for youth under age 25 have declined markedly in recent years, including in the wake of the 2007-2009 recession. Certain young people-including high school dropouts, current and former foster youth, and other at-risk populations-face challenges in completing school and entering the workforce. While the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in secondary school attendance in the past several decades, approximately 9% of youth ages 18 through 24 have not attained a high school diploma or its equivalent. In addition, millions of young people are out of school and not working. Since the 1930s, federal job training and employment programs and policies have sought to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. Generally, these young people have been defined as being at-risk because they are economically disadvantaged and have a barrier to employment. During the Great Depression, the focus was on employing young men who were idle through public works and other projects. The employment programs from this era included an educational component to encourage youth to obtain their high school diplomas. Beginning in the 1960s, the federal government began funding programs for low-income youth that address their multiple needs through job training, educational services, and supportive services. Today's primary federal youth employment and job training programs are authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA, P.L. 105-220), and are carried out by the Department of Labor's (DOL's) Employment and Training Administration (ETA). Although these programs are funded somewhat differently and have varying eligibility requirements, they generally have a common purpose-to provide youth with educational and employment opportunities and access to leadership development and community service activities. Many of the programs target the most vulnerable youth, including school dropouts, homeless youth, and youth offenders. Based on funding and the number of youth served, the WIA Youth Activities (Youth) formula program and Job Corps are the largest. The Youth Activities program provides an array of job training and other services through what are known as local workforce investment boards. The program was funded at $820.4 million in FY2014. Job Corps provides training in a number of trades at centers where youth reside, and received FY2014 appropriations of $1.7 billion. Another program, YouthBuild, engages youth in educational services and job training that focus on the construction trades. YouthBuild received FY2014 appropriations of $77.5 million. Separately, WIA's pilot and demonstration authority has been used to carry out the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program (RExO), which provides job training and other services to juvenile and adult offenders. The youth component was funded at $43.9 million in FY2013 (FY2014 funding is not yet available). Finally, the Youth Opportunity Grant (YOG) program, which was funded until FY2003, was targeted to youth who lived in select high-poverty communities. In FY2003, the program received $54.6 million. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Background: The framework for expanding children's school access in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been directed by universal education policies as part of Education for All since 1990. In measuring progress to universal education, a narrow conceptualisation of access which dichotomises children's participation as being in or out of school has often been assumed. Yet, the actual promise of universal education goes beyond this simple definition to include retention, progression, completion, and learning. Objective: Our first objective was to identify gaps in the literature on children's school access using the zones of exclusion of the Consortium for Research on Educational Access, Transition, and Equity as a framework. Second, we gave consideration to how these gaps can be met by using longitudinal and cross-country data from Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites within the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Population and Their Health (INDEPTH) in LMICs. Design: Using Web of Science, we conducted a literature search of studies published in international peerreviewed journals between 1998 and 2013 in LMICs. The phrases we searched included six school outcomes: school enrolment, school attendance, grade progression, school dropout, primary to secondary school transition, and school completion. From our search, we recorded studies according to: 1) school outcomes; 2) whether longitudinal data were used; and 3) whether data from more than one country were analysed. Results: The area of school access most published is enrolment followed by attendance and dropout. Primary to secondary school transition and grade progression had the least number of publications. Of 132 publications which we found to be relevant to school access, 33 made use of longitudinal data and 17 performed crosscountry analyses. Conclusions: The majority of studies published in international peer-reviewed journals on children's school access between 1998 and 2013 were focused on three outcomes: enrolment, attendance, and dropout. Few of these studies used data collected over time or data collected from more than one country for comparative analyses. The contribution of the INDEPTH Network in helping to address these gaps in the literature lies in the longitudinal design of HDSS surveys and in the diversity of countries within the network. © 2015 Mamusu Kamanda and Osman Sankoh.},

abstract={Entertainment-education (E-E) approaches for young audiences continue to evolve in order to keep stride with younger generations affinity for technology. E-E and novelas have been used with a wide variety of audiences in the United States, in particular hard-to-reach Latino populations, and have demonstrated effectiveness in disseminating culturally relevant prevention information for a wide variety of health-related risk factors and behaviors. This study discusses the formative research and active engagement of Latino youth living in Langley Park, Maryland, for the development and filming of an innovative 6-episode webnovela titled Victor and Erika (V&E). V&E is part of a larger branding strategy of the Adelante Positive Youth Development intervention that seeks to prevent substance abuse, sexual risk, and interpersonal violence among Latino youth; V&E is also an intervention component. The V&E webnovela is a dramatic portrayal of the lives of 2 immigrant Latino teenagers that also disseminates risk prevention messages. The storyline represents the turning the corner (to a better life) theme that underlies the Adelante intervention brand. Formative research was conducted for character development (n = 20) and creative development of the episodes (n = 14). Results of the formative research showed that youth recommended inclusion of the following topics in V&E episodes: sex, unintended pregnancy, fidelity, trust, family dynamics, immigration status, violence, school dropout, respect, home life, and poverty. Detailed character and episode descriptions are provided, and the implications of using the V&E series as a tool for in-person and online engagement of youth and the dissemination of prevention messages are also discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Harnessing conceptual inspiration through the work of Harriet Tubman and Queen Nanny the Maroon of Jamaica, this book explores the historical and contemporary role that education has - and can continually play as an instrument of personal and group liberation. The book discusses the early formations of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the enslavement of native populations, and the subsequent development of the Underground Railroad and Maroon societies in the Caribbean and Americas as systems of liberation. It investigates the development and maintenance of racial, gendered and class stratification, and provides a personal path to freedom as a context for a broader discussion on using education as a mechanism for dismantling the effects of colonization, miseducation, and social-psychological domination in schools and society. As a contemporary issue, it presents an in depth analysis of the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona, and the controversy surrounding its ethnic studies program as an example of one of the contested sites of curriculum development and student liberation. Additionally, it discusses high performing charter schools as an alternative model of education, which may help to provide a systematic way of unshackling institutional barriers and oppression. Ultimately, this book acknowledges that today the road to freedom is still one we must all travel as: miseducation, school failure, school dropout, unemployment/underemployment, poverty, neighborhood violence, incarceration, and a growing prison industrial complex are all reminders of the work that still must be accomplished. Like those who historically sacrificed their lives to gain freedom and an education, today, with the lingering effects of institutionalized systems of domination, education must continue to be an instrument of social mobility and liberation, if indeed, we are to make schools and society more humane and inclusive towards those who are still waiting to be unshackled. The book presents implications regarding the treaties on education for freedom as a school reform and public policy topic. © 2014 Sense Publishers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this study, we propose a group-based trajectory analysis to examine why and how people fall into and out of poverty despite spiralling public expenditure on anti-poverty policies. By analyzing the poverty experiences of 1,001 low-income households between 1999 and 2008 in Korea, we identify five groups based on their poverty trajectories: exiting, declining, slowly rising, rapidly rising and chronic. Household members in each group demonstrate heterogeneous labour market experiences, educational levels and demographic factors. The exiting group has a high proportion of full-time workers, high school graduates, and younger and male-headed households, whereas the chronic group has more part-time workers, high school dropouts, and older and female-headed households. Among the declining, slowly rising and rapidly rising groups, educational background, age and sex are factors that differentiate the poverty dynamics of household members. Lastly, a number of social policies for helping low-income households to leave and stay out of poverty are proposed. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The objective of this study is to empirically investigate a two-way statistical relationship between the social health indicators and economic growth in the context of four major regions of the world i.e., East Asia and Pacific, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. To recognize the relationship between the two variables, a time series, co-integration and Granger causality tests have been employed. Aggregate secondary data pertaining to these four regions from 1975 to 2011 on economic growth and social health indicators i.e., infant mortality, child abuse, child poverty, unemployment, weekly wages, health insurance coverage, teenage suicide, teenage drug abuse, high school dropouts, poverty, out-of-pocket health costs, homicides, alcohol related traffic fatalities, food insecurity, income inequality, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, basic health units and rural health centers has been used for analysis. This study evaluates four alternative but equally plausible hypotheses, each with different policy implications. These are: (1) social health indicators Granger cause economic growth, (2) economic growth Granger cause social health indicators (the conventional view), (3) There is a bi-directional causality between the two variables and (4) Both variables are causality independent (although highly correlated). The empirical results only moderately support the conventional view that economic growth has significant long run casual effect on social health indicators in East Asia and Pacific, MENA, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The present study find evident of unidirectional causality running towards economic growth to social health indicators, although, there are some bidirectional causality also exists between the variables. The percentage of unidirectional causality between economic growth and social health indicators is larger than bidirectional or neutrality hypothesis. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Secondary school is a period during which risk of school dropout is highest. To date, little research has examined reasons for school dropout amongst HIV/AIDS-orphaned children, who are affected economically, psychosocially and educationally. HIV/AIDS orphanhood can perpetuate poverty and increase school dropout in a range of ways, including inability to pay school fees, family disruption and stigma. Related research mostly focuses on school performance and completion and, more recently, on context-specific approaches to measure educational outcomes. The primary aim of this qualitative study was to examine how HIV/AIDS orphanhood influences participation in secondary education in South Africa and to investigate why some HIV/AIDS-orphaned adolescents find it easier to stay in school than others. Specifically, the study aimed to explore, interpret and elicit the perceptions of South African HIV/AIDS-orphaned adolescents (N = 243, aged 13–22, 53 % female, 47 % male) towards potential risk and protective factors influencing their secondary school attendance. Findings suggest complex and interconnecting multiple risk factors such as poverty pre- and post-parental death, crisis-fosterage often accompanied by further traumatic events, changing schools sporadically, recurring household migration and forced employment all of which can create obstacles to secondary education. Protective factors that emerged included extra-curricular activities and teacher/community support. These findings highlight the need for evidence-informed school and community policies, which consider the effects of household poverty, migration and living arrangements, if secondary school participation for HIV/AIDS-orphaned adolescents is to be promoted and sustained. © 2014, Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={This paper presents a review of causes of school dropout in BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. This review is apposite considering that previous literatures have not closely dwelt on such a comparative stance, but given that this group of countries have some economic interest in common, that also translates to social development, it is thus pertinent to review similarities in their school dropout factors. Insight from the literature indicates that school dropout in BRICS countries is an amalgam of closely related factors that culminate to learners dropping out of school. These factors include inter alia, poverty, disability, family configuration, orphan-hood, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse, lack of effective teaching method, poor academic performance, and child labour. The paper goes beyond the review and evaluates the relationship between school dropout, government education expenditure and poverty in South Africa. The result indicates that a combination of poverty and low government expenditure on education may aggravate school dropout. This thus suggests that government education expenditure should be formulated to effectively accommodate the rural poor communities. © 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ghana, a lower-middle income country that is still grappling with fertility and birth rates, initiated family planning for the youth decades ago. This mainly targeted deprived communities, and the Muslim youth were also exposed to contraception. However, contraception awareness among the Muslim youth has had difficulties and repercussions. Against the social and economic challenges facing the Ghanaian Muslim youth, this article evaluates their awareness about contraception focusing on the issues and their ramification with the aim of identifying prospects for development. The findings reveal that awareness is high but not in a positive sense as the general patronage among couples is low, while among the unmarried, the awareness has negatively affected their morality. Among the issues, there is a disconnection between service providers and the community while some Muslims think that contraception can reduce the Muslim population and is un-Islamic. It was argued that contraception is permitted for Muslims provided there is ethical justification and that in view of the social and economic challenges, including school dropouts and Muslim child migration due to the poverty of parents, the Muslim youth must plan their childbirth. Hence, it was recommended that government must tackle the problem of education in Muslim communities. The Ulama should also dialogue with the service providers to create trust between the health providers and the Muslims. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Development sectors like health cannot function in isolation. Intersectoral coordination between various departments helps in bringing a positive change in the health-seeking behavior of society in the long run. The decision by the Government of India to provide free solar lanterns (lamps) to the school-going girls of below poverty line families is a welcome step in this context. This initiative would help in reducing the number of school dropout girls and thus help in improving the health indicators that are directly related to women's education. Thus it is an initiative that will help in attainment of Millennium Development Goals through women's education and empowerment. Along with that, the environment-friendly approach will definitely have an impact on health of the girls by switching from kerosene/wood stoves to solar lantern light. Also this initiative would pave the path of real "intersectoral coordination" in the health sector in India that is marred with watertight functioning of various departments. There is an urgent need to popularize the scheme and involve different stakeholders like corporate houses, media, nongovernment organizations, multinational welfare agencies, and local governing bodies for ensuring the availability and utilization of solar lanterns in India. © Copyright Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Public education is closely connected to the challenge of income inequality, racial/ethnic disparities, and the urban environment in our society. In the nation’s largest central city school districts, more than 60 percent of the students are eligible for free or reducedprice school lunch programs, a sign of poverty. African American students constitute about one-third of the enrollment in large central cities as compared to about 15 percent nationwide. The nation’s growing Latino population experiences significant school dropout problems. Schools that have a higher concentration of minority and low-income students are less likely to recruit qualified teachers, offer rigorous curricula, and maintain high academic performance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The majority of young people in the United States grow up healthy and safe in their communities. Most of those of school age live with parents who provide for their well-being, and they attend schools that prepare them for advanced education or vocational training and, ultimately, self-sufficiency. Many youth also receive assistance from their families during the transition to adulthood. During this period, young adults cycle between attending school, living independently, and staying with their families. Approximately 60% of parents today provide financial support to their adult children who are no longer in school. This support comes in the form of housing (50% of parents provide this support to their adult children), living expenses (48%), cost of transportation (41%), health insurance (35%), spending money (29%), and medical bills (28%). Even with this assistance, the current move from adolescence to adulthood has become longer and increasingly complex. For vulnerable (or "at-risk") youth populations, the transition to adulthood is further complicated by a number of challenges, including family conflict or abandonment and obstacles to securing employment that provides adequate wages and health insurance. These youth may be prone to outcomes that have negative consequences for their future development as responsible, self-sufficient adults. Risk outcomes include teenage parenthood; homelessness; drug abuse; delinquency; physical and sexual abuse; and school dropout. Detachment from the labor market and school-or disconnectedness-may be the single strongest indicator that the transition to adulthood has not been made successfully. The federal government has not adopted a single overarching federal policy or legislative vehicle that addresses the challenges vulnerable youth experience in adolescence or while making the transition to adulthood. Rather, federal youth policy today has evolved from multiple programs established in the early 20th century and expanded in the years following the 1964 announcement of the War on Poverty. These programs are concentrated in six areas: workforce development, education, juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, social services, public health, and national and community service. They are intended to provide vulnerable youth with opportunities to develop skills to assist them in adulthood. Despite the range of federal services and activities to assist disadvantaged youth, many of these programs have not developed into a coherent system of support. This is due in part to the administration of programs within several agencies and the lack of mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In response to concerns about the complex federal structure developed to assist vulnerable youth, Congress passed the Tom Osborne Federal Youth Coordination Act (P.L. 109- 365) in 2006. Though activities under the act were never funded, the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs was formed in 2008 under Executive Order 13459 to carry out coordinating activities across multiple agencies that oversee youth programs. Separately, Congress has considered other legislation (the Younger Americans Act of 2000 and the Youth Community Development Block Grant of 1995) to improve the delivery of services to vulnerable youth and provide opportunities to these youth through policies with a "positive youth development" focus. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={In an increasingly global economy, and with retirement starting for the Baby Boomer generation, Congress has indicated a strong interest in ensuring that today's young people have the educational attainment and employment experience needed to become highly skilled workers, contributing taxpayers, and successful participants in civic life. Challenges in the economy and among certain youth populations, however, have heightened concern among policymakers that some young people may not be prepared to fill these roles. The employment levels for youth under age 25 have declined markedly in recent years, including in the wake of the 2007-2009 recession. Certain young people-including high school dropouts, current and former foster youth, and other at-risk populations-face challenges in completing school and entering the workforce. While the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in secondary school achievement in the past several decades, approximately 9% of youth ages 18 through 24 have not attained a high school diploma or its equivalent. In addition, millions of young people are out of school and not working. Since the 1930s, federal job training and employment programs and policies have sought to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. Generally, these young people have been defined as being at-risk because they are economically disadvantaged and have a barrier to employment. During the Great Depression, the focus was on employing young men who were idle through public works and other projects. The employment programs from this era included an educational component to encourage youth to obtain their high school diplomas. Beginning in the 1960s, the federal government began funding programs for low-income youth that address their multiple needs through job training, educational services, and supportive services. Today's primary federal youth employment and job training programs are authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA, P.L. 105-220), and are carried out by the Department of Labor's (DOL's) Employment and Training Administration (ETA). Although these programs are funded somewhat differently and have varying eligibility requirements, they generally have a common purpose-to provide youth with educational and employment opportunities and access to leadership development and community service activities. Many of the programs target the most vulnerable youth, including school dropouts, homeless youth, and youth offenders. Based on funding and the number of youth served, the WIA Youth Activities (Youth) formula program and Job Corps are the largest. The Youth formula program provides an array of job training and other services through what are known as local workforce investment boards (WIBs). Job Corps provides training in a number of trades at centers where youth reside. Another program, YouthBuild, engages youth in educational services and job training that focus on the construction trades. Separately, WIA's pilot and demonstration authority has been used to carry out the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, which provides job training and other services to juvenile and adult offenders. Finally, the Youth Opportunity Grant (YOG) program, which was funded until FY2003, was targeted to youth who lived in select high-poverty communities. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The Early College High School (ECHS) initiative developed in response to calls to significantly decrease the number of first-generation college and underserved students of color and from poverty who are high school dropouts or marginally graduates (i.e., ill prepared for college). The ECHS model is different from other educational reforms in that secondary and postsecondary faculty work collaboratively to align curriculum and supports that facilitate a successful high school-to-college transition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the initial implementation of ECHS on student achievement and nonacademic indicators in a high-poverty setting. Results indicated that, after an initial year of implementation, achievement results on criterion-referenced tests were significantly higher for all students relative to matched control students, but the statistically and practically significant impact on norm-referenced tests was limited to students enrolled in ECHS courses; school attendance remained the same, but suspensions were decreased. Implications for high school reform and research are discussed. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Economic disadvantage is a strong predictor of social exclusion, disengagement at school, early school dropout and low educational attainment. This paper shows that experience of significant events - for example, moving home and school following parents' separation; a sudden fall in family income; or illness and death in the family - can greatly exacerbate economically disadvantaged young people's sense of exclusion and disengagement. Survey data are used to show that such negative events (often characterised by young people as 'shocks') are most likely to occur among economically disadvantaged families with children. In-depth interviews with young people are also used to explore young people's construction of these events, which they often describe in terms of a cascade, with several shocks following each other in rapid succession, draining away their, and their families', economic, social and emotional resources, and leaving them at risk of further exclusion. The paper concludes that policy needs to buffer young people better from the effects of these events, and so reduce their disengagement and exclusion.},

abstract={People across Africa are urbanizing and cities act as magnets that attract poor migrants from rural areas, looking for employment and better life. During the last few decades, the informal sector has been growing fast in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia due to the influx of many young workers into the sector who come from rural areas of the country with the expectation of a better life in the city. The informal sector employment includes casual, temporary jobs such as lottery selling, street vending, petty trade and other similar activities - coping strategies and earning strategies to escape food poverty. The informal sector is believed to play an important role in food security as it provides jobs, reduces unemployment, bolsters economic activity, and helps alleviate poverty. However, there is limited local knowledge about the role of this sector in enhancing food security and reducing vulnerability of the emigrants. There is also limited research about the problems and prospects of the informal sector, and via-a-vis its potential contribution towards food security. Therefore, this research was conducted with the major objective of examiningthe food security level and vulnerability status of emigrants worker and their households to identify the major challenges and prospects for future policy interventions. Primary data were collected from 240 respondents (60 from each of the four sub-cities) who were selected randomly. Secondary data were also collected from government offices. Data were analyzed using both descriptive and econometric approaches. Probit model was used to determine food security status of respondents; whereas ordered probit model was used to identify the factors affecting their vulnerability level. Results suggest that the daily life of the majority of migrants in Addis Ababa (most of them are young school dropouts) is highly connected with street-based informal economic activities such as marketing, vending and lottery selling, etc. Results show that the annual mean income a household would earn is Eth. Birr 7,786.2 ($442). Results of the vulnerability analysis show that informal activities in the study area serve migrants only as temporary safety nets, not as sustainable earnings/livelihood strategies. Results further show that lack of access to bank credit (due to collateral requirements), fluctuating market prices and lack of working premises impacts their work. Data shows that the workers are forced to consume less food or poor quality food. Therefore, future urban policy may need to give due consideration to informal sector employment in order to realize synergies between the formal and informal sectors for addressing food security and poverty issues. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The introduction of universal primary education in sub-Sahara African countries in the 1990s increased enrolment rates and provided opportunities to children who were previously not in school. Research demonstrates that eliminating fees is not the magic bullet that delivers universal access. This study seeks to determine risk factors associated with dropout among primary school children in the low-income areas of Nairobi. Qualitative data is from the Education Research Program, collected between June and July 2008. The study found that: dumpsites in the two slum sites of Korogocho and Viwandani lure children out of school; school levies still charged in schools keep children out of school; and chronic poverty within families lure girls aged 14-16 into transactional sex. In conclusion, the declaration of free primary education is not sufficient to realize improved educational attainment as dropout after initial entry negates the purpose for which it was introduced. © 2013 © 2013 British Association for International and Comparative Education.},

abstract={We compare the employment of African American and white youth as they transition to adulthood from age 18 to 22, focusing on high school graduates and high school dropouts who did not attend college. Using OLS and hazard models, we analyze the relative employment rates, and employment consistency, stability, and timing, controlling for a number of factors including family income, academic aptitude, prior work experience, and neighborhood poverty. We find white high school graduates work significantly more than all other youth on most measures; African American high school graduates work as much and sometimes less than white high school dropouts; African American dropouts work significantly less than all other youth. Findings further suggest that the improved labor market participation associated with a high school diploma is higher over time for African Americans than for white youth. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The intent of this study was to examine the status of educational exclusion of pastoral Dasanech children in the primary schools of South Omo Zone, and identifying the major geo-economic impediments in their educational inclusion. To serve this purpose, descriptive survey research method was employed. The data were gathered from the sample of students, teachers, and educated personnel from Dasanech ethnic group, Parent-Teacher Association members, tribal chiefs and ethnically Dasanech school dropouts. Applying diversified sampling techniques drew these respondents. Apart from document analysis, information was solicited from the sample respondents through questionnaire, Interview and Focus Group Discussion. Mixed method procedures of Sequential Explanatory Strategy were used to analyze and interpret both the quantitative and qualitative data. The findings indicated that the status of educational exclusion of pastoral nomad Dasanechs' children in the primary school of the south Omo zone is low as compared to other ethnic groups. Whereas, the dropout rate of children from primary is high above the regional average. Based on the findings, geo-economic predicaments, like poverty, conflict, parents' illiteracy, nomadism, high demand of child labor and problem of health have been found to be the major geo-economic constraints. Formulation of specific policy and strategy for pastoral children education, school location mapping, flexible academic calendar, construction of semi-sedentary education centers and boarding schools, and introducing mobile tent schools, promoting participatory conflict management approaches were recommended.},

abstract={This study examines the effects of secondary school dropout syndrome on child and the society in Nigeria. Purposely, the study used descriptive statistics to analyse the impacts that dropout syndrome may have on child and the economy. Two factors are identified as being major sources of the high dropout rate in the country and these are individual characteristics and socio-demographic factors. The results show that dropping out of school severely limits the chances of future success for far too many children as it deepens and continues the cycle of poverty into future generations. The study concludes by recommending that any dropout prevention programmes must begin early and that all stakeholders (families, schools and communities) must be actively involved © Medwell Journals, 2013.},

abstract={Background: Some studies show orphanhood to be associated with increased sexual risk-taking while others have not established this relationship, but have found factors other than orphanhood as predictors of sexual risk behaviours and outcomes among adolescents. This study examines community members' perceptions of how poverty influences adolescent sexual behaviour and outcomes in four districts of Nyanza Province, Kenya. Methods. Eight study sites within the four districts were randomly selected. Focus group discussions were conducted with a purposive sample of adolescents, parents and caregivers. Key informant interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of community leaders, child welfare and healthcare workers, and adolescents. The two methods elicited information on factors perceived to predispose adolescent orphans and non-orphans to sexual risks. Data were analysed through line-by-line coding, grouped into families and retrieved as themes and sub-themes. Results: Participants included 147 adolescents and parents/caregivers in 14 focus groups and 13 key informants. Poverty emerged as a key predisposing factor to sexual risk behaviour among orphans and non-orphans. Poverty was associated with lack of food, poor housing, school dropout, and engaging in income generating activities, all of which increase their vulnerability to transactional sex, early marriage, sexual experimentation, and the eventual consequences of increased risk of unintended pregnancies and STI/HIV. Conclusion: Poverty was perceived to contribute to increasing sexual risks among orphan and non-orphan adolescents through survival strategies adopted to be able to meet their basic needs. Policies for prevention and intervention that target adolescents in a generalized poverty and HIV epidemic should integrate economic empowerment for caregivers and life skills for adolescents to reduce vulnerabilities of orphan and non-orphan adolescents to sexual risk behaviour. © 2013 Juma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={This paper examines the differentials of school attendance patterns. i.e. never attended, entered into school, dropout rate, repeating, left school two or more years ago and child work by economic condition of household in India. The wealth index is used to understand the economic differentials in child schooling of households. The study findings suggest that children belonging to the poorest wealth quintile of households are significantly more likely never to have attended school, have higher dropout rates and be over-age compared to children belonging to wealthier and the wealthiest quintiles. The states’ differentials in child school attendance patterns showed that the state of Bihar has the highest proportion of children never having attended compared to lowest proportion for Kerala (39 percent vs. 2 percent). The working children among poor households are more deprived to attend school compared to children from wealthier households. This paper concludes that economic conditions of the household are the main determinant of child schooling in India. © 2013, Korea Institute of Child Care and Education.},

abstract={School mobility has been shown to increase the risk of poor achievement, behavior problems, grade retention, and high school dropout. Using data over 25 years from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, we investigated the unique risk of school moves on a variety of young adult outcomes including educational attainment, occupational prestige, depression symptoms, and criminal arrests. We also investigated how the timing of school mobility, whether earlier or later in the academic career, may differentially predict these outcomes over and above associated risks. Results indicate that students who experience more school changes between kindergarten and 12th grade are less likely to complete high school on time, complete fewer years of school, attain lower levels of occupational prestige, experience more symptoms of depression, and are more likely to be arrested as adults. Furthermore, the number of school moves predicted outcomes above and beyond associated risks such as residential mobility and family poverty. When timing of school mobility was examined, results indicated more negative outcomes associated with moves later in the grade school career, particularly between 4th and 8th grades.

abstract={The overall goal of this study is to examine if there is a dropout problem in rural China and to explore the effectiveness of a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme on the rate of dropping out. To meet this goal, we conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact of the CCT using a sample of the poorest 300 junior high school students in a nationally-designated poor county in Northwest China. We find that the annual dropout rate in the study county was 7.8 per cent and even higher, 13.3 per cent, among the children of poor households. We demonstrate that a CCT program reduces dropout by 60 per cent. The programme is most effective among students with poor academic performance, and likely more effective among girls and younger students. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article describes rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP), getting pregnant or giving birth again within 24 months of giving birth, in a group of unmarried, low-income, African American first-time, adolescent parent couples from the perspectives of their kinship systems, that is, the adolescent parents and their parents or parental figures. RRP has been associated with prematurity, low birth weight, inadequate prenatal care, school dropout, increased potential for poverty, and prolonged welfare dependence. There were 21 RRPs among 24 kinship systems: 9 adolescent males who fathered RRPs with new partners and also reported having been denied access to their study babies; 6 adolescent mothers with new partners, who also reported intimate partner violence with the study adolescent father; and 6 study adolescent parent couples, whose paternal family reported doubts about the paternity of the study babies. Adolescent fathers should be offered the same child care and contraceptive information routinely offered to adolescent mothers. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={The socio-economic situation of the Arab-Bedouin population in the Negev is examined in light of the general Israeli Arab population. Based on the Galilee Society’s social survey for 2004 Israeli Arab poverty incidence was found to be 52 % with nearly two-thirds in persistent poverty. Among Bedouins living in villages unrecognized by the Israeli government poverty incidence was nearly 80 %, and poverty severity, as measured by the Sen-Poverty index, was as high as seven times than that among the mainstream population in Israel, i.e., the Jewish population (excluding the—predominantly poor—ultra orthodox Jews). Similarly to international evidence, we found that education, age, family size, employment, and occupation of the household head and the number of income earners in the family are important determinants of the probability of being poor. We show that the rapid increase of Arab women’s student enrollment rates not only reduced the education gap compared to Arab men but importantly adds to poverty reduction through various channels. Bedouin households, especially in the unrecognized villages, were found to have much less access to infrastructure compared to other Arabs, thus implying that the lack in infrastructure forms a significant barrier to women’s participation in the labor force. This was also found to have an adverse indirect effect on the completion of schooling, and indirectly on mothers’ fertility, keeping it relatively high by reducing education’s potentially diminishing effect on poverty. A considerable mismatch between skills and employment was found among Arab academics, thus pointing at the possibility of discrimination and segregation in the relevant labor market. Considering various transmission mechanisms, we show that government intervention in infrastructure has a high expected social return, both through direct and indirect channels and could, thus, help in interrupting the vicious circle of poverty. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={Latina students have the highest high school dropout rate of all racial and ethnic groups. This article has three objectives: provide a brief overview of educational trends for Latina students, discuss factors associated with their educational trajectory and suggest strategies for change based on best practice wisdom. Results show that academic disparities between Latina students and other racial/ethnic female students begin as early as kindergarten and remain through age 17; achievement is compromised by a variety of factors, including family responsibilities, family poverty, lack of participation in preschool, attendance at poor quality elementary and high schools, placement into lower-track classes, poor self-image, limited neighborhood resources, lack of presence of role models and gender role attitudes. These disparities contribute to psychosocial issues and are not directly associated with Latino cultural assets, as Latino cultural capital has not been easily translated into social capital in U.S. society. Economic and social change must precede educational change if academic disparities between Latinas and other racial and ethnic girls are to be decreased. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Progress in education of the girl child in sub-Saharan Africa in general and South Africa in particular has been impeded by the high rates of school dropout, which occurrence has implications for the attainment of the MDGs, particularly eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, improving the health of children and mothers, achieving gender equality and empowerment of women, curbing the spread of HIV and AIDS and other diseases and improving environmental sustainability. The objectives of the study were to assess the magnitude of school dropout and identify factors influencing this tendency in the North West province. The study used event history data on 582 women collected by use of the cross-sectional research design. It found that school dropout rates are significantly influenced by factors that include high rates of school pregnancies, low grades at a high age, low educational attainment of mothers and a young age atfirst sexual intercourse. The paper recommends greater emphasis of sexual abstinence through school based programmes, zero tolerance to sexual crimes involving minors by raising the age threshold for such crimes, reducing over-age enrolments and adoption of flexible schooling systems to accommodate pregnant and student mothers.},

abstract={This prospective study of 276 Virginia public high schools found that the prevalence of teasing and bullying (PTB) as perceived by both 9th-grade students and teachers was predictive of dropout rates for this cohort 4 years later. Negative binomial regression indicated that one standard deviation increases in student- and teacher-reported PTB were associated with 16.5% and 10.8% increases in the number of dropouts, respectively, after controlling for the effects of other predictors, including school size, student body poverty and minority composition, community crime rates, and performance on standardized achievement testing. The predictive values of student and teacher perceptions of PTB were comparable in magnitude to the predictive values for other commonly recognized correlates of dropout rates.

abstract={Previous studies on school dropout in Cambodia often used data from subjects after they already dropped out or statistics from education-related institutions. Using data from children in two rural provinces before they dropped out, this study examines four main factors in order to identify their influence on primary school dropout in Cambodia. Results from logistic regression analysis revealed that some predictors on individual, family, and school factors were found to be statistically significant to predict the odds of dropout in both grades 1 and 5, whereas poverty and child labor could not be detected, though they have been frequently cited as major predictors in the literature of school dropout in Cambodia as well as developing countries. © 2012 Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.},

abstract={Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis and, unlike most cancers, HCC incidence and mortality rates are increasing in the United States. While risk is known to vary among different racial and ethnic groups, less is known about the variability of risk within these groups by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: HCC cases diagnosed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 11 cancer registries between 1996 and 2007, and the population of the SEER 11 catchment areas was studied. Analyses were conducted to compare census tract area family poverty, educational attainment, and unemployment by race and ethnicity. A multiple linear regression model, weighted by the number of cases and the number of individuals in each census tract, with adjustment for registry, was used to calculate mean differences in arealevel attributes between HCC cases and the population. Results: HCC cases in most racial/ethnic groups had lower mean neighborhood-level measures of SES than their referent population. An exception was seen among Hispanics. Comparing white cases with cases of other racial groups and to Hispanics, white cases lived in neighborhoods with less family poverty, fewer high-school dropouts, and lower unemployment. Compared with white cases, Asian and Pacific Islander and Hispanic cases lived in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of foreign-born population. Conclusions: Low neighborhood-level SES and immigrant statusmaybe associated with greater risk of HCC within specific racial and ethnic groups. Impact: These findings could help to focus control resources for HCC toward the most affected communities. ©2012 AACR.},

abstract={In this paper we consider why students in poor and rural regions of China are dropping out of school in numbers that may be greater than official statistics admit. With questions about education quality among the most intractable in Education for All initiatives across the developing world, we sketch a portrait of education in a remote mountain village community as it might be painted from the perspective of a primary school dropout: a portrait in which education quality is well in the shadows. We indicate the limits of the view that commonly relates the phenomenon of school dropout primarily with poverty, a lack of school resources and inequities in resource distribution, suggesting that the picture is more nuanced and subtly shaded at local levels. Our research indicates that the education system in the radically transitional society that China is today brings with it values that clash with those of its citizens, particularly those who are marginalized and cannot easily adjust, perhaps because of their disadvantaged socio-economic, cultural and geographic location. In an ethnographic study in a poor, rural area in Yunnan province, we found significant disjunctions in values: between those of the school system and those of parents with regard to the aims and purposes of education; between those of the curriculum and those of teachers with regard to their role in the classroom vis-à-vis knowledge as represented in textbooks; between those of government education policy and the concerns of the remote rural poor with regard to resource distribution; and between those of a newly market-oriented society and educational ideals about teachers' and students' abilities. We also offer some insight into the scale and complexity of the problems associated with a lack of education quality and students' dropping out of school as a consequence, which cannot be revealed by the official 1% dropout rate. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority youth group in the United States. Currently, Latino adolescents experience higher rates of teen pregnancy compared to any other racial or ethnic group and have disproportionately high levels of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. Latino teens are also affected by a number of social problems such as school dropout, poverty, depression and limited access to healthcare, which contributes to disparities in reproductive health outcomes for this population. Relatively few intervention research studies and programs have been dedicated to reducing sexual risk among Latino youth, despite their particular vulnerabilities in experiencing negative reproductive health outcomes. We provide recommendations for identifying the unique reproductive health needs of Latino youth and specific applied strategies so that agency-based social workers and other providers can develop family-based interventions that improve adolescent Latino sexual and reproductive health. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The alarming incidence of drop-out at primary level is pervasive in many developing countries. The dropout among school children in India is a problem of poor and destitute families where parents can not keep up with the financial demands of schooling or are even unable to provide for their basic subsistence needs. Wide differentials exist in the literacy rate between male and female and the gap is still high despite the various schemes initiated by the government. This paper describes the socio-economic determinants of primary school dropout in South-east Delhi having high concentration of vulnerable urban poor. The main objective of the study was to identify the socio-economic factors that influence dropout of the students at primary level. A total sample of 129 respondents were selected from four government primary schools of south east Delhi. Data were collected from respondents and their parents through specific interview schedules. The major findings revealed that family type, income, occupation and education of parents have direct influence over dropout rates. The rate of drop out is higher among girls which is a major cause of concern. Hence the study calls for the appropriate policies of education system and reduction in poverty of the masses. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={Students who enter school with limited English proficiency are among the most likely of all students to be at risk for school failure (August & Hakuta, 1997). These students score substantially worse than other Ianguage minority students in schools of equal levels of poverty in both reading and mathematics at third grade (Moss & Puma, 1995). They are retained far more often, and have many other difficulties. Ultimately, limited English proficient (LEP) students are substantially more likely than other students to drop out of school; dropout rates average 42% for these students, compared to 10.5% for students who were never limited in English proficiency (McArthur, 1993). The educational difficulties of limited English proficient students are not entirely due to difficulties with English. These students are typically children of recent immigrants who suffer from the effects of poverty, mobility, limited capacity of parents to support their children's success in school, and underfunded, overcrowded schools (August & Hakuta, 1997). Even after limited English proficient students become fully proficient in English, their school performance remains substantially lower than that of other students (McArthur, 1993). © 2001 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

abstract={Population loss through net outmigration is endemic to many rural areas. Over a third of nonmetro counties lost at least 10 percent of their population through net outmigration over 1988-2008. Some of these counties have had very high poverty rates, substantial loss in manufacturing jobs, and high unemployment. Lack of economic opportunity was likely a major factor in their high outmigration. Most high net outmigration counties, however, are relatively prosperous, with low unemployment rates, low high school dropout rates, and average household incomes. For these counties, low population density and less appealing landscapes distinguish them from other nonmetro counties. Both types of outmigration counties stand out on two measures, indicating that qualityof-life factors inhibit inmigration: a lack of retirees moving in and local manufacturers citing the area’s unattractiveness as a problem in recruiting managers and professionals. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Trading in human beings - historically known as slavery - is now called trafficking. There are two principal causes of trafficking: poverty, which makes people vulnerable to exploitation, and criminality, in the form of agents and employers willing to exploit the poor. Child trafficking is generally attributed to economic crisis at home and big family falling prey to the agents' tempting offers and an aspiration to lead urban life style in cities. In the context of this study, children who went missing or were trafficked from the rural areas of five panchayats in Madhepura district of Bihar for various purposes have been categorized as a case of 'Child trafficking'. These five panchayats were selected for the reason that in this area Emmanuel Hospital Association (EHA) has its medical and social intervention. The majority of 60 per cent of the respondents in the study identified themselves as child labour/trafficking victims, whereas 22 per cent were identified as bonded labourers and 7 per cent as domestic servants. Over 95 per cent of the respondents were found to be unskilled labour, indicating that they had no opportunity to learn a skill or undergo vocational trainings for their livelihood. This made them vulnerable to trafficking and pushed them to the risk zone of maximum exploitation. Over 50 per cent of the parents had more than 5-6 children and this turn out to be one of the main reasons for the parents to have sent away their 1-2 children to places like Delhi. These children are engaged in hotels, grocery shops and small scale industries like making bangles, envelopes, carpets, crackers, brick kilns, etc. Traffickers help them in connecting these children to the needy employers and in turn receive a huge amount and pay the parents a share of it. Parents justify it saying that their children are learning a skill and making their livelihood. Over 71 per cent respondents were trafficked at some point of time owing to their financial needs at home. Owing to the awareness generated by the Government and several civil society groups, the local people in the villages were scared to mention that their child, below 18 years, has been trafficked. For want of police interrogation and other legalities, they were also cautious to mention that their children do not fall below 14 years and to be working as a child labour. Several cases of "missing child" were reportedl, but the parents were reluctant to share it openly for the fear of any further police interrogations. Due to scarcity of funds at home, many children after the middle school prefer taking up a job in another state and are prone to trafficking. Contractors' involvement, advance money, school dropouts, engaged in work at an early age, missing children are an indication of child trafficking.},

abstract={Based on the premise that social phenomena are not evenly distributed in geographic space, this study aims to explore the spatial patterns of social groups in the city of Córdoba (Argentina), associating them with certain risk behaviors among children and adolescents, especially those related to the reproduction of inequality, poverty, and exclusion. First, we identify the different socio-residential areas comprising the city, from the analysis of the distribution of social groups in the urban space, with special emphasis on education and housing characteristics. Second, we calculate the differentials for risk behavior among children and adolescents (school dropout rates, youth inactivity, and late adolescence fertility) according to the aforementioned areas of residence.

abstract={This article documents a cross-sectional survey of 135 males between the ages of 12 and 17.5 years, who were exposed to militancy, in Swat, Pakistan. The data were collated from Sabaoon, a rehabilitation facility. The results reveal the mean age of the males to be15.5 years. Fifty-two per cent of the sample was in the middle birth order. Fifty-two per cent came fromlow socioeconomic status (i.e. <US $ 93/month or $3/day); 30% were school dropouts; in 65% of the cases, supervising authority figures were absent; 37% were fromamong 5 and/or 6 siblings, and 29.5% were fromamong 8 and/or 9siblings. The militants had abducted 58.5% of the students while 41.5% had volunteered for militancy. The results highlight that poverty, poor quality of life, large family size, illiteracy, and, lack of supervision can serve as potential demographic risk factors in making children vulnerable to militancy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background/Context: The academic success and failure of low-income youth, and Black and Latina/o youth in particular, has received significant attention in the educational literature, particularly in relation to school dropout. Cher the last decade, several studies have demonstrated that student-teacher relationships, committed teachers, and notions of caring are critical to the success of Latina/o youth. However, high-poverty urban schools are graduating fewer than half of their students, in comparison with about 70% at the national level There remains a scant body of research, policy, and conceptual frameworks to help address the crisis, popularly deemed the "dropout crisis,"particularly among Latinas/os, the youngest, fastest growing, and lowest educated group in the United States. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: In what ways can and should researchers, practitioners, and policy makers recognize the existence of Latina/o youth ? The purpose of the article, contextualized in the theoretical and empirical literature, is to prob- lematize the concept of recognition, particularly for Latina/o youth, and introduce a conceptual framework to understand, examine, and help rectify the crisis facing this population. Research Design: In this conceptual paper, I argue that key stakeholders must recognize the existence of the Latina/o youth by acknowledging their human existence through legitimizing the unequal conditions and struggles they face in school. Educators much engage youth in curricular and pedagogical experiences that seek to raise students' consciousness through critical thinking and dialogue. This article is focused on the human and interpersonal actions and processes that are necessary to facilitate agency and change among students. Theoretical origins informing recognition are discussed, folloxued by a contextualized analysis of recognition within the present-day conditions of U.S. schools, particularly for Latina/o youth. I then propose five pedagogies of recognition: relational recognition, curricular recog- nition, pedagogical recognition, contextualizing recognition, and transformative recognition. Each form of recognition is situated in the relevant literature. Conclusions/Recommendations: This article argues that the proposed pedagogies of recognition need to be enacted to foster the intellectual, academic, and political development of youth, particularly Latina/o youth. Recognition can help educators and scholars understand how the social, political, and economic conditions impact Latina/o youth and helps educators reframe the conceptual bases of their work by challenging them to interrogate the (ineffectiveness of institutional and classroom-level practices. The ultimate goal is to help educators and researchers reconstruct and redefine the purpose of education for Latina/o youth in U.S. schools. © 2012 Teachers College.},

abstract={Feelings of hopelessness are prospectively associated with increased risk of death, progression of atherosclerosis and other health outcomes. Places as well as people may promote a sense of hopelessness. We used the Chicago Community Adult Health Study to investigate whether feelings of hopelessness cluster at the neighborhood level. Random-intercept logistic models were used to examine associations of hopelessness with neighborhood conditions (physical disorder and decay, perceived violence and disorder, social cohesion) and census-based measures of neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (poverty, unemployment, % high school dropouts) from 1980-2000. Of the 3074 participants, 459 were categorized as experiencing hopelessness. Greater physical disorder and perceived disorder and a higher unemployment rate were associated with increased odds of hopelessness. Individuals' reports of hopelessness reflect physical, socioeconomic, and opportunity characteristics of their neighborhoods above and beyond their individual characteristics. Changing opportunity structures in a neighborhood may play a key role in reducing individuals' feelings of hopelessness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Youth of color are disproportionately likely to grow-up in poor, disadvantaged neighborhoods characterized by high levels of psychosocial stressors and inadequate supportive resources. Poverty and racial minority status correlate with an increased risk of high-school dropout, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Given these trends, child welfare researchers are developing various interventions to increase the protective resources and social opportunities available to youth of color. This article reports results of a preliminary, qualitative study that investigated the feasibility and acceptability of an economic empowerment intervention in the South Bronx and East Harlem, New York. Using focus groups and brief questionnaires with youth and their parents/guardians (N = 24 dyads), we explored attitudes toward youth educational savings accounts, financial planning classes, and mentorship for inner-city youth. Findings indicate a strong interest in an economic empowerment intervention among adolescents and their caregivers in these communities. These findings have implications for the design of larger-scale research programs that aim to improve inner-city youth's socio-economic wellbeing using economic empowerment models. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In an increasingly global economy, and with retirement starting for the Baby Boomer generation, Congress has indicated a strong interest in ensuring that today's young people have the educational attainment and employment experience needed to become highly skilled workers, contributing taxpayers, and successful participants in civic life. Challenges in the economy and among certain youth populations, however, have heightened concern among policymakers that some young people may not be prepared to fill these roles. The employment levels for youth under age 25 have declined markedly in recent years, and the current recession may cause these levels to decrease further. Certain young people-including high school dropouts, current and former foster youth, and other at-risk populations-face challenges in completing school and entering the workforce. While the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in secondary school achievement in the past several decades, approximately 9% of youth ages 18 through 24 have not attained a high school diploma or its equivalent. In addition, millions of young people are out of school and not working. Since the 1930s, federal job training and employment programs and policies have sought to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. Generally, these young people have been defined as being at-risk because they are economically disadvantaged and have a barrier to employment. During the Great Depression, the focus was on employing young men who were idle through public works and other projects. The employment programs from this era included an educational component to encourage youth to obtain their high school diplomas. Beginning in the 1960s, the federal government began funding programs for low-income youth that address their multiple needs through job training, educational services, and supportive services Today's primary federal youth employment and job training programs are authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA, P.L. 105-220), and are carried out by the Department of Labor's (DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA). Although these programs are funded somewhat differently and have varying eligibility requirements, they generally have a common purpose-to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, as well as to leadership development and community service activities. Many of the programs target the most vulnerable youth, including school dropouts, homeless youth, and youth offenders. Based on funding and the number of youth served, the WIA Youth Activities (Youth) formula program and Job Corps are the largest. The Youth formula program provides an array of job training and other services for youth through what are known as local workforce investment boards (WIBs). Job Corps provides training in a number of trades at centers where youth reside. Another program, YouthBuild, engages youth in educational services and job training that focus on the construction trades. Separately, WIA's pilot and demonstration authority has been used to carry out the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, which provides job training and other services to juvenile and adult offenders. Finally, the Youth Opportunity Grant (YOG) program, which was funded until FY2003, was targeted to youth who lived in select high-poverty communities.© 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={This study reveals that despite the negative effects of migration, the Tanzanian government has not done enough to address migration-related health issues. This is owing to inadequate data or information about effects of migration in the country. Dodoma region, the focus of this study, is selected for its migration-inducing factors as they relate to the declining health status of its inhabitants. Harsh climatic conditions causing irregular and inadequate rainfall and prolonged drought have led to a severe decline of the health of the poor. The region is entirely dependent on subsistence agriculture and livestock production. The small-scale production is locally practiced at household level. Extreme poverty motivates rural people to migrate to cities with the main migrant groups being middle school (about 13 to 15 years old) and high school dropouts (15 to 18 years old), and youth including young parents (18 to 35 years old). The rural-urban migration conjoined with harsh climatic conditions significantly downsizes local population, available agricultural labor force, and further endangers food security. More importantly, however, due to exposure to HIV in the cities, most migrants who are unable to find city jobs return home terminally ill with HIV/AIDS, which further adds to impoverishment of rural families and to downsizing of rural population.

abstract={Objective: To study the impact of mental disorders on failure in educational attainment in Mexico. Methods: Diagnoses and age of onset for each of 16 DSM-IV disorders were assessed through retrospective self-reports with the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI) during fieldwork in 2001-2002. Survival analysis was used to examine associations between early onset DSM-IV/CIDI disorders and subsequent school dropout or failure to reach educational milestones. Results: More than one of two Mexicans did not complete secondary education. More than one-third of those who finished secondary education did not enter college, and one of four students who entered college did not graduate. Impulse control disorders and substance use disorders were associated with higher risk for school dropout, secondary school dropout and to a lesser degree failure to enter college. Anxiety disorders were associated with lower risk for school dropout, especially secondary school dropout and, to a lesser degree, primary school dropout. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of results found in Mexico may be due to the effect of mental disorders being diminished or masked by the much greater effect of economic hardship and low cultural expectations for educational achievement. Future research should inquire deeper into possible reasons for the better performance of students with anxiety disorders in developing countries.},

abstract={Each year, 1. 3 million students fail to graduate, dropping the United States' high school graduation rate to 69%. One of the most salient predictors of high school dropout is socio-economic status (SES), which makes important an improved understanding of the reasons why SES affects educational outcomes. In this study, multilevel mediation models were utilized to examine parental investment in school as a mediator of the relationship between SES and educational outcomes among an ethnically diverse sample of 64,350 7th to 9th grade students from 199 rural communities and towns in the U. S. (50% male, 63% non-Hispanic White). These relationships were assessed at the individual and school district level. Results indicate that parental investment is an important mediator at both levels. Within school districts, 28% of the effect of SES on the expectation to graduate from high school is mediated by perceived parental investment. Between school districts, 60% of the effect of concentrated disadvantage on the district's high school graduation rate and nearly all (87%) of the effect of concentrated disadvantage on the average expectation to graduate from high school among students in the district is mediated by perceived parental investment. Implications for prevention are discussed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Previous contextual analyses of recidivism are limited by a focus on traditional disadvantage indicators. The authors examine whether those indicators, including poverty, family composition, high school dropout, and unemployment explain disproportionate involvement in serious criminal recidivism among African American relative to White ex-prisoners. Given the fundamental necessity of finding employment after release, the authors move beyond traditional measures and investigate the availability of low-skill employment opportunity in the industries that prior research suggests are most likely to hire ex-prisoners (retail and manufacturing). To address the issue, the authors collected and geo-coded data for a representative sample of 1,568 Ohio ex-prisoners released on community supervision during the first six months of 1999. Contextual analysis reveals that race difference in serious recidivism is explained by low-skill employment opportunity in manufacturing and that it is contingent on levels of neighborhood disadvantage and unemployment. © The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract={This book looks at the way we tax the poor in the United States, particularly in the American South, where poor families are often subject to income taxes, and where regressive sales taxes apply even to food for home consumption. Katherine S. Newman and Rourke L. O'Brien argue that these policies contribute in unrecognized ways to poverty-related problems like obesity, early mortality, the high school dropout rates, teen pregnancy, and crime. They show how, decades before California's passage of Proposition 13, many southern states implemented legislation that makes it almost impossible to raise property or corporate taxes, a pattern now growing in the western states. Taxing the Poor demonstrates how sales taxes intended to replace the missing revenue-taxes that at first glance appear fair-actually punish the poor and exacerbate the very conditions that drove them into poverty in the first place. © 2011 by The Regents of the University of California.},

abstract={The majority of young people in the United States grow up healthy and safe in their communities. Most of those of school age live with parents who provide for their well-being, and they attend schools that prepare them for advanced education or vocational training and, ultimately, self-sufficiency. Many youth also receive assistance from their families during the transition to adulthood. During this period, young adults cycle between attending school, living independently, and staying with their families. On average, parents give their children an estimated $38,000, or about $2,200 a year, while they are between the ages of 18 and 34 to supplement wages, pay for college tuition, and assist with down payments on a house, among other types of financial help. Even with this assistance, the current move from adolescence to adulthood has become longer and increasingly complex. For vulnerable (or "at-risk") youth populations, the transition to adulthood is further complicated by a number of challenges, including family conflict or abandonment and obstacles to securing employment that provides adequate wages and health insurance. These youth may be prone to outcomes that have negative consequences for their future development as responsible, self-sufficient adults. Risk outcomes include teenage parenthood; homelessness; drug abuse; delinquency; physical and sexual abuse; and school dropout. Detachment from the labor market and school-or disconnectedness-may be the single strongest indicator that the transition to adulthood has not been made successfully. Approximately 1.8 million noninstitutionalized civilian youth are not working or in school. The federal government has not adopted a single overarching federal policy or legislative vehicle that addresses the challenges vulnerable youth experience in adolescence or while making the transition to adulthood. Rather, federal youth policy today has evolved from multiple programs established in the early 20th century and expanded in the years following the 1964 announcement of the War on Poverty. These programs are concentrated in six areas: workforce development, education, juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, social services, public health, and national and community service. They are intended to provide vulnerable youth with opportunities to develop skills to assist them in adulthood. Despite the range of federal services and activities to assist disadvantaged youth, many of these programs have not developed into a coherent system of support. This is due in part to the administration of programs within several agencies and the lack of mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In response to concerns about the complex federal structure developed to assist vulnerable youth, Congress passed the Tom Osborne Federal Youth Coordination Act (P.L. 109-365) in 2006. This legislation, like predecessor legislation that was never fully implemented-the Claude Pepper Young Americans Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-501)-establishes a federal council to improve coordination of federal programs serving youth. Congress has also considered other legislation (the Younger Americans Act of 2000 and the Youth Community Development Block Grant of 1995) to improve the delivery of services to vulnerable youth and provide opportunities to these youth through policies with a ?positive youth development? focus.

abstract={Latinos are the largest, fastest growing, and youngest ethnic group in the United States, and the primary factor responsible for this growth is high fertility. It is estimated that by 2025, 24 percent of U.S. youth will be Latino, up from 15 percent in 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). Reproductive health concerns include high rates of teen pregnancy, teen births, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV/AIDS. The reasons behind these reproductive health disparities can be better understood by looking at other social and structural factors in young Latinos lives. Overall, these comprise important public health issues facing the Latino community. Since 1990, U.S. teen pregnancy rates have decreased steadily, a trend driven mainly by decreases among African American and white teens. Latina teen pregnancy rates increased slightly in the early 1990s, then decreased overall by a smaller margin than other racial/ethnic groups between 1990 and 2002 (19 percent as compared to 40 percent and 34 percent among African American and white teens) (Guttmacher Institute 2006). Thus, Latina teen birth rates remain the highest among any major racial/ethnic group. Over half (51 percent) of Latinas in the United States will become pregnant at least once during their teenage years, and one in five sexually active Latino teen males will cause a pregnancy (National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy [NCPTP] 2006). The negative consequences of early, unintended pregnancy are well established. These include lessened educational and employment opportunities for family members, including fathers, and worse health outcomes for both mother and child that extend throughout the life course (NCPTP 2002). Beyond pregnancy, rates of STIs, including HIV, are substantially higher among Latinos. In 2004, one-quarter of new HIV/AIDS cases among adolescents ages thirteen to nineteen occurred among Latinos (Kaiser Family Foundation and Ford Foundation 2001). The growing number of Latinos living with HIV/AIDS has resulted in nearly a quarter of Latinos naming the disease as the most urgent health problem facing the nation (Kaiser Family Foundation and Ford Foundation 2006). Until recently, the importance of focusing on young men in the prevention of teen and unintended pregnancies has not been widely recognized; the number of policy initiatives and programs involving males in sexual and reproductive health care remain limited. Even fewer sexual/reproductive health programs and services are geared to serve Latino males in a culturally competent manner (Sonenstein 2000). Such programs are important, as males, particularly Latino males, are at higher risk of acquiring STIs because they tend to be younger when initiating sex and they have more sexual partners than their female counterparts (Kann et al. 2000). This lack of attention has a twofold effect: first, Latino men are left without the appropriate sexual/reproductive health care, education, and knowledge necessary to motivate changes in sexual behavior. Secondly, an absence of male involvement in decision making with regard to family planning hinders efforts to decrease unintended pregnancies and the spread of STIs among both Latino men and women. Research on the sexual and reproductive health of Latino males to inform clinical practice and public health programs is often lacking. The determinants and characteristics of sexual and reproductive health differ substantially across gender and ethnic/racial groups and subpopulations. Therefore, one must be cautious before generalizing existing research on mainstream populations and across Latino subpopulations (Kowaleski-Jones and Mott, 1998). Social and structural factors, including poverty, educational attainment, immigrant generation, place of birth, and geographic location, have been linked to sexual and reproductive health behaviors and outcomes, but the research examining this is limited. Poverty, often accompanied by diminished access to health care, social isolation, substandard living conditions, and psychosocial hardship, affects health and health care access over the life course. Poor levels of educational attainment make it difficult for many Latinos to rise out of poverty. They remain a small proportion of the college population (around 10 percent), in part due to an elevated high school dropout rate (Shin 2005; Laird et al. 2006). Over two-thirds (65 percent) of Latino students are the children of at least one immigrant parent and 18 percent are foreign-born themselves (Shin 2005). Immigration profoundly shapes the lives and experiences of Latino families living in the United States. Many Latino youth are growing up in environments and with cultural influences that are vastly different from those experienced by their parents. These circumstances can lead to an array of challenges in communicating with parents and conflicts surrounding social mores and behavior (Driscoll et al. 2004). Youth with foreign-born parents experience higher poverty rates, go less far in school, have more limited English skills, and are less likely to receive public assistance, including Medicaid, than low-income children whose parents were native-born. Many recent Latino immigrants, particularly those from Mexico, have moved to rural areas across the United States. Barriers to accessing reproductive health care services may be greater for those living in rural and remote areas where affordable and culturally competent health care services are often less accessible. Particularly for migrant farm-working families, inaccessible site locations impede enrollment in public health programs, and frequent movement across states increases barriers to health care given state residency requirements for Medicaid coverage (Rosenbaum and Shin 2005). The sum of these social and structural factors places Latino youth at a great disadvantage. It is critical to understand the diversity of Latino male youth as part of an analysis of the role of social and structural factors in the sexual and reproductive health of young Latinos. © 2010 by Rutgers University Press.

abstract={A new era of mass immigration, accelerating since the 1970s and largely coming from developing countries of Latin America and Asia, has transformed the ethnic composition of the U.S. population. Today about 70 million people are of foreign birth or parentage-23 percent of all Americans, including 90 percent of all Asians and 76 percent of all Hispanics (Portes and Rumbaut 2006). They include nearly 70 million foreign-born persons-of whom 12 million are estimated to be undocumented immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Central America (Passell 2006)-and another 40 million of foreign parentage. This immigrant-stock population, the largest ever, is a youthful one-and todays U.S.-born second generation, with a median age of twelve, is poised to explode into adulthood in the coming ten to twenty years. They are coming of age in an otherwise aging society undergoing profound social and economic transformations, a process that is straining the social contract between natives and newcomers and raising questions about how the commitment to democratic values of equity and inclusion will be met (Myers 2007; Tienda 2002). The incorporation of these newcomers has coincided with a postindustrial period of economic restructuring and rising inequality, during which the returns to education and advanced educational credentials have sharply increased. Simultaneously, the U.S. labor market has become bifurcated into high-tech/high-wage and manual/low-wage sectors-attracting distinct streams of immigrant workers, from skilled professionals to undocumented laborers. As the post-World War II era of sustained economic growth, low unemployment, and rising real wages ended for most workers by the early 1970s, men with only a high-school degree or less were hardest hit. For example, the proportion of those workers who failed to earn enough in a year to support a family of four at the poverty line grew between 1975 and 1993 from 25 to 50 percent among Hispanics, from 31 to 45 percent among non-Hispanic blacks, and from 14 to 24 percent among non-Hispanic whites (Danziger 2004). Postsecondary schooling significantly lengthened for young people, with the years from eighteen to the mid- and even late twenties becoming increasingly devoted, often with continuing parental support, to the accumulation of human capital and college credentials. Many changes occurred at this time-women entered the labor market in large numbers and worked longer hours, two-income families became the norm, and the baby boom was followed by a baby bust and delayed childbearing. Additionally, there were changes in family forms, including what has come to be called a "retreat from marriage," with high divorce rates (which peaked in 1980 but have remained high since) and sharp increases in cohabitation and nonmarital childbearing (Landale et al. 2006). In short, social timetables that were widely observed a half century ago for accomplishing adult transitions have become less predictable and more prolonged, diverse, and disordered (Settersten et al. 2005). The new era of mass immigration has also coincided with an era of mass imprisonment in the United States, which has further transformed paths to adulthood among young men with low levels of education (Pettit and Western 2004). The number of adults incarcerated in federal or state prisons or local jails in the United States skyrocketed during this period, quadrupling from over 500,000 in 1980 to 2.2 million in 2005 (U.S. Department of Justice 2006). The majority are young men between eighteen and thirty-four. Those figures do not include the much larger number of those on probation (convicted offenders not incarcerated) or parole (under community supervision after a period of incarceration). When they are added to the incarceration totals, over 7 million adults were under correctional supervision in the United States in 2006. Imprisonment rates vary widely by gender (over 90 percent of inmates in federal and state prisons are men); by racial-ethnic groups (there were 4,834 black male prisoners per 100,000 black males in the United States, compared to 1,778 Hispanic males per 100,000 and 681 white males per 100,000, although since 1985 Hispanics have been the fastest growing group being imprisoned); and by education. This is most salient among racial minorities for whom becoming a prisoner has become a modal life event in early adulthood. Stunningly, as Pettit and Western (2004) have noted, a black male high school dropout born in the late 1960s had a nearly 60 percent chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s, and recent birth cohorts of black men are more likely to have prison records than military records or bachelors degrees. Whether the future of Latino men without a high school diploma will approximate those patterns or not remains an open empirical question. During the years of the transition to adulthood from the late teens through the twenties, as postsecondary educational attainment has become critical to social mobility for both men and women, incarceration (for young men) and early childbearing (for young women) have emerged as two turning points- albeit fundamentally different ones-that can derail life course trajectories by blocking or disrupting educational and occupational opportunities to develop human capital and move into the economic mainstream. Having a prison record is not only linked to unemployment, lower wages, marital and family instability, and severe restrictions on social and voting rights (including lifetime disenfranchisement in many states), but also to stigmatized identities and pathways to criminal recidivism (Laub and Sampson 2003). In a cycle of cumulative disadvantage, young men and women with low levels of education are significantly more likely to become prisoners or young parents, respectively, than same-age and same-sex peers with higher levels of education. © 2010 by Rutgers University Press.

abstract={This article investigates the long-term effects of parental migration abroad on the schooling of children left behind in Albania. Although parents' migration usually benefits children economically, the lack of parental care may cause relational and psychological problems that may affect children's welfare in the long term. The phenomenon of children left behind - mainly by fathers - is considerable in Albania, where migration has represented the only viable way to cope with an increasing poverty and the scarcity of public resources for sustaining households' incomes. Between 1990 and 2005 in Albania 22 per cent of children under 18 have been left behind, with an average parental absence of 9 months. Using detailed information on family migration drawn from the Living Standard Measurement Survey for 2005, multiple-choice models are applied to evaluate the school progression of older children and adolescents. A duration analysis of school participation with both discrete and continuous time models is then performed. The results show that past parental migration has a negative effect on school attendance in the long term with higher hazards of school dropouts for children left behind. These results are robust to the use of different econometric techniques and model specifications. © 2010 CEIS, Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Each year the Tax Foundation releases rankings of U.S. states on time to Tax Freedom, or the day that the average taxpayer has met their tax burden. The current analysis sought to contextualize the tax freedom day rankings, by examining the association between state tax burden and key indicators of child wellbeing. The 2009 measure of days to tax freedom by state was correlated with ten key indicators of child wellbeing from the Casey Foundation's KIDS COUNT 2009 data. Each of the wellbeing indicators and the overall composite wellbeing rankings were also regressed on days to Tax Freedom and Gross State Product. As the days to tax freedom decrease, indicating a lighter tax burden, all of the following increase significantly - the infant mortality rate, child and teen death rates, teen birth rate, rates of school dropout and disconnected youth, and numbers of children in poverty. These findings all held even after controlling for Gross State Product. Public attitudes and choices about paying taxes have important consequences for the health of children in our society. The broad appeal of Tax Freedom Day highlights a disconnect between the act of paying taxes and recognition of the benefits to children those taxes provide. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={While marijuana use is common during adolescence, it can have adverse long-term consequences, with serious criminal involvement being one of them. In this study, we utilize longitudinal data from the Woodlawn Study of a community cohort of urban African Americans (N=702) to examine the effects of heavy adolescent marijuana use (20 or more times) on adult criminal involvement, including perpetration of drug, property and violent crime, as well as being arrested and incarcerated. Utilizing propensity score matching to take into account the shared risk factors between drug use and crime, regression analyses on the matched samples show that heavy adolescent marijuana use may lead to drug and property crime and criminal justice system interactions, but not violent crime. The significant associations of early heavy marijuana use with school dropout and the progression to cocaine and/or heroin use only partially account for these findings. Results suggest that the prevention of heavy marijuana use among adolescents could potentially reduce the perpetration of drug and property crime in adulthood, as well as the burden on the criminal justice system, but would have little effect on violent crime. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={This article deals with issues relating to education of Chuktia Bhunjia tribe of Orissa, highlighting the major factors determining girls’ education in this society. While looking at the low literacy of the girl child, factors like material culture, life cycle rituals and customary cultural norms are found largely responsible for high drop out from school. However, poverty, school timings and need of girl children in household chores are other causes of this. However, few girls have dared to cross the customary laws to carve out a space for themselves, even as the fear of social ostracism forces many parents to stop sending their girls child to schools. Thus, it is pertinent here to find out ‘alternatives’ so as to encourage girls’ education without dismantling their social structure as well as traditional cultural practices. Further, there is a need to redraft, fine tune them with cultural practices and social norms, as the existing policies fail to facilitate equal rights to everybody as enshrined in the Constitution of India. © 2010, SAGE Publications Ltd.

Using data from the 1997-2000 National Health Interview Surveys (linked to mortality data through 2002) and the 1996-2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, we calculated age-specific health-related quality-of-life scores and mortality probabilities for 8 social and behavioral risk factors. We then used Markov models to estimate the quality-adjusted life years lost. Results. Ranked quality-adjusted life years lost were income less than 200% of the poverty line versus 200% or greater (464 million; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 368, 564); current-smoker versus never-smoker (329 million; 95% Cl = 226, 382); body mass index 30 or higher versus 20 to less than 25 (205 million; 95% Cl = 159, 269); non-Hispanic Black versus non-Hispanic White (120 million; 95% Cl =83, 163); and less than 12 years of school relative to 12 or more (74 million; 95% Cl = 52, 101). Binge drinking, overweight, and health insurance have relatively less influence on population health. Conclusions. Poverty, smoking, and high-school dropouts impose the greatest burden of disease in the United States.},

abstract={Pregnant and parenting adolescents continue to be an at-risk population in schools. With a 60% dropout rate, they are far less likely than their peers to graduate from high school, and they and their children are more likely to live in poverty than parents who delay pregnancy beyond adolescence. Skillsbased interventions that include problem-solving and coping skills have been found to be effective in school programs with other adolescent problems, such as drugs and alcohol, school dropout, and antisocial behavior. Such interventions are gaining support as being effective with teen parents. This chapter examines the foundations of a cognitive-behavioral skills-based approach, as well as the compatibility of using a task-centered group for skills-building interventions. It looks at the Taking Charge curriculum, a group intervention for helping adolescent mothers achieve coping and problemsolving skills toward graduating from high school, and becoming more competent parents and self-sufficient adults. © 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

abstract={The aims of this study were to examine whether use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs predicts dropout among secondary school students in Cape Town, South Africa. A self-report instrument was administered to 1,470 Grade 8 students. The proportion of students that dropped out of school between the onset of the study and 4 years later was 54.9%. After adjusting for a range of confounders, dropout was significantly predicted by absenteeism, poverty (as assessed by a possession index), and past month cigarette use, but not by past month alcohol use and lifetime illicit drug use. Contrary to findings from developed countries, alcohol and illicit drug use did not predict dropout. It is possible that predictors of dropout documented elsewhere may not be pertinent in developing countries. © 2010, Copyright the Author(s).

abstract={The knowledge of the nutritional and medicinal benefits of some vegetables found around the south west-Nigeria was tested among cross section of market women in Lagos state Nigeria, using questionnaires and coloured pictures of seventeen of these vegetables. This study was carried out in Lagos state which houses a cross section of the nation ethnic groups and also serves as the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria. One thousand market women with varying level of education were selected and tested on proper identification and their knowledge on nutritional and medicinal benefits of seventeen vegetables found around them. Sociodemographic data such as age, educational status were also recorded. The results revealed high percentage school dropout among the market women. There is also a level of ignorance about the available vegetables around among the market women thou there seems to be a good appreciation of their medicinal values. Considering the capital base of these women especially the largest age bracket of 21-45 years, we suggested that financially empowering them will reduce the vicious circle of poverty associated with school dropout among girls in Nigeria. The populace need to be educated about the readily available vegetables around them to reducing the incidence of macronutrient deficiencies. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2010.},

abstract={There is a disparate and growing literature on the effects of communities- or more specifi cally, neighborhoods-on behavioral outcomes of residents (Buka et al. 2001; Margolin and Gordis 2000); see Kroneman, Loeber, and Hipwell (2004) for a review of neighborhood context, delinquency, and gender. This literature stems from a long history of sociological work, embodied primarily in the social disorganization tradition (Bursik and Grasmick 1993a; Sampson and Groves 1989; Sampson, Morenoff, and Gannon-Rowley 2002), developmental psychology (Brooks- Gunn, Duncan, and Aber 1997a, 1997b; Brooks-Gunn, et al. 1993; Jencks and Mayer 1990; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2000) and, more recently, economics (Durlauf 2004). Literature reviews have been done in each of these areas (Durlauf 2004; Jencks and Mayer 1990; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2000; Salzinger et al. 2002b; Sampson, Morenoff, and Gannon-Rowley 2002). Unlike theories focused on individual characteristics, theories emphasizing neighborhood context include an emphasis on the place where individuals live and events transpire. Variables examined include household structure, residential mobility, population density, cultural disadvantage, poverty, concentrated disadvantage, social cohesion or disorganization, and social capital. Dependent variables are highly variable, making comparisons between studies more diffi cult. They include risky behaviors, school dropout or truancy, physical and emotional health, exposure to and use of violence, victimization, and crime and delinquency. In general, studies fi nd that urban neighborhoods with concentrated poverty have higher rates of juvenile violence (Lauritsen and White 2001; McNulty and Bellair 2003a, 2003b; Messner, Raffalovich, and McMillan 2001), violent victimization, exposure to violence (Farrell and Bruce 1997; Margolin and Gordis 2000; Molnar et al. 2005), and juvenile and adult arrests for property and personal crime (Krivo and Peterson 1996; Schuck and Widom 2005; Steffensmeier and Haynie 2000a) than rural poor neighborhoods or neighborhoods without this concentration. They are also associated with earlier teen pregnancy, earlier school leaving, and a host of other negative effects. How specifi cally neighborhoods impact girls versus boys, and whether the effects vary for girls, is not well researched (Jacob 2006; Steffensmeier and Haynie 2000b, 2002b). © 2009 by The Temple University Press.

abstract={Educational success is often synonymous with attainment of academic qualifications. However for some students, simply continuing to attend school rather than dropping out may represent an important attainment, and completion of secondary school significantly reduces chances of subsequent chronic poverty. The longitudinal US NELS dataset was assessed to examine predictors of dropout. Results supported a differentiated perspective of student outcomes whereby dropout before Grade 12 was predicted far less by prior academic achievement in Grade 8 than academic achievement in Grade 12, and to a greater extent by non-cognitive measures such as daily school preparation, planning and subjective peer perception. Cognitive ability measures are known to correlate well with academic achievement but "non-cognitive abilities" may have an important role in the prediction of persistence, especially among marginalised students. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Adolescent constitute over 21.4 % of the population in India. This period needs special attention because of turmoil of adolescence faces due to different stages of development, different circumstances, different needs and diverse problems. The psychosocial and emotional problems are of considerable magnitude and they may exert significant influence on their nutritional status. Unfortunately assessment of nutritional status of adolescent girls has been the least explored area of research particularly in rural India Objective: To assess the Nutritional problems amongst the adolescent girls. • To find out the reproductive problems amongst the adolescent girls. • To suggest the recommendation based on Study findings. Methods:The approach adopted for this community based study was cross sectional one. One Community Development Block (i.e. Chiplun) was selected from nine CD Block of the Ratnagiri District by simple random sampling. Anganwadi centre of Chiplun were stratified into 3 strata according to distance Viz. < 15 Km, 15-30 Km and > 30 Km) from Institute and from each stratum three bit were selected by simple random sampling. In the selected Anganwadi centre three adolescent girls were selected. This served as the sampling frame. The information on age, Weight, Height, BMI, Socioeconomic status, menstrual problems, and reproductive problems were assessed. The hemoglobin concentration as well as MCHC was measured. The data was collected and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Results: The mean age of the study subjects was calculated to be 16.9 years. Most (77.6) of the subjects were students followed by school dropout (22.4). As per Proposed Asian and WHO criteria, 67.8% & 69.3% adolescent girls were under weight (BMI < 18.5). Adolescent girls who were categorized as overweight by Proposed Asian (23 to 24.9 kg/m2) and Previous WHO (25-29.9 kg/m 2) criteria's were 2 % and 2.4% respectively. As much as 41.9% study subjects were anaemic (Hb < 12 gm %) as per WHO guidelines. It was found that 68.9% (MCHC < 34 %) of the study subjects were showed hypochromic red cells suggesting Iron deficiency anaemia. The mean age of the menarche was found to be 13.7 years. As far as problems related to menstruation cycle were concerned Dysmenorrhea (44.2%) was the commonest problems faced by adolescent girls. Irregular menses 16.9%, Irritation-21.7%, Malaise - 9.5% , Headchae-14.2, chest pain- 8.2% , abdominal bloating 20.3% , constipation- 11.3%, tightness in chest 10.6%. White discharge-38.3 %. Conclusion: The study concludes that majority of the girls had clinically obvious nutritional deficiency diseases. Two third of study subjects were undernourished (BMI <18.5 kg/m 2). The prevalence of anaemia among the adolescent girls was found to be 41%.There was a significant association of anaemia with educational status of adolescent girls. Majority more than three fourth of the adolescent girls were suffering from menstrual related problems which leads to reproductive morbidities. Adolescents are expected to enjoy a good health but this does not seem to be in rural areas of developing country like India, where poverty, malnutrition and repeated infection are rampant. To achieve the optimum health and development of the adolescent segment of the population. There is a need to introduce a comprehensive Adolescent Health Initiative (AHI) at block level.},

abstract={More than 300 rural counties are more prosperous than the nation. Each has lower unemployment rates, lower poverty rates, lower school dropout rates, and better housing conditions than the nation. Prosperous counties tend to have more educated populations, more diverse economies, more private non-farm jobs, more farmers and government farm payments, more creative class occupations, and more equal income distributions. They have fewer African-American, American Indian, or Hispanic residents and fewer recent immigrants. Some findings support what many rural people believe to be true: civically engaged religious groups and other identities that bind people together can really matter. Other results contradict conventional wisdom. For instance, climate and distances to cities and major airports, are relatively unimportant. Focusing on prosperity, instead of growth or competitiveness, provides new insights into rural conditions and prospects. © 2009 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Research and practice in the vast field of school-family-community relations have evolved dramatically over the last thirty years. Schools throughout the world face enormous challenges due to demographic changes and societal problems, making partnerships among schools, families and community groups a necessity. Specific issues such as poverty, school dropout, violence and suicide, the wider diversity of students and parents, the higher accountability demanded of school systems, the implementation of school reforms and a multitude of government strategies and policies all contribute to a rapidly changing educational world. But as this book shows, even though research is often being undertaken independently in different countries, strong similarities are apparent across countries and cultures. School-family-community collaboration is no longer a single country issue. The book brings together contributions from culturally and linguistically diverse countries facing these common situations and challenges. It details practices that have proved effective alongside relevant case examples, and covers a wide variety of topics, including: challenges arising from the application of parent-school legislation at national level the work of schools with migrant groups, low-income parents and parents with behaviour problems. evaluation of various family-school-community partnerships programs the way ahead for Family-School-Community Relations With contributions from distinguished researchers from throughout the world (including the United States, Canada, the UK, Europe, China and Australia). It is a perfect companion to International Perspectives on Student Outcomes and Homework, also edited by Rollande Deslandes, and published simultaneously by Routledge. © 2009 editorial and selection, Rollande Deslandes.

abstract={This chapter addresses the question: how much progress have we made in improving the conditions of poor and low-income children and their parents? It looks beyond the public welfare paradigm to some of the other salient issues, including mental health issues, the role of the courts, poverty, the distinction between inadequate care and abuse, institutional neglect and abuse, and "foster care drift" (the practice of moving a child from one foster home to another). It discusses matters relating to family preservation, the notion of supporting safe and stable families: cash assistance, waivers, single parenting, high school dropout rates, chronic health issues, employment, and eligibility issues. It is shown that a truly effective system of child welfare and protection must include and embrace a myriad of diverse but related issues affecting parents and children. It is argued that the child welfare paradigm has all but collapsed in the face of broader problems and that the future is vague and disconcerting. © 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

abstract={This paper evaluates a United Kingdom pilot study designed to test whether a means-tested conditional cash transfer paid to 16- to 18-year-olds for staying in full-time education is an effective way of reducing the proportion of school dropouts. The transfer's impact is substantial: In the first year, full-time education participation rates increase by around 4.5 percentage points while the proportion receiving two years of education increases by around 6.7 percentage points. Those receiving the full payment have the largest initial increase in participation and some evidence is found suggesting that part of the effect can be explained by liquidity constraints. © 2009 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.},

abstract={The presence of street gangs has been hypothesized as influencing overall levels of violence in urban communities through a process of gun-drug diffusion and cross-type homicide. This effect is said to act independently of other known correlates of violence, i.e., neighborhood poverty. To test this hypothesis, we independently assessed the impact of population exposure to local street gang densities on 8-year homicide rates in small areas of Los Angeles County, California. Homicide data from the Los Angeles County Coroners Office were analyzed with original field survey data on street gang locations, while controlling for the established covariates of community homicide rates. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses explicated strong relationships between homicide rates, gang density, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic structure. Street gang densities alone had cumulative effects on small area homicide rates. Local gang densities, along with high school dropout rates, high unemployment rates, racial and ethnic concentration, and higher population densities, together explained 90% of the variation in local 8-year homicide rates. Several other commonly considered covariates were insignificant in the model. Urban environments with higher densities of street gangs exhibited higher overall homicide rates, independent of other community covariates of homicide. The unique nature of street gang killings and their greater potential to influence future local rates of violence suggests that more direct public health interventions are needed alongside traditional criminal justice mechanisms to combat urban violence and homicides.},

abstract={Academic achievement-schooling completed and degrees attained, as well as the skills and capabilities associated with these credentials-is an important determinant of socioeconomic success. Few if any personal characteristics are more strongly and positively related to an individual's later occupational attainment, employment, earnings, home ownership, health, and other measures of a successful life. In addition, as the United States' and other national economies have evolved, technological innovation and globalization have advanced, and labor union strength has declined, the economic return to academic achievement has increased. Thus, for example, in inflation-adjusted, 1999 dollars, the average American male high school dropout earned $13.61 an hour in 1973, and $9.78 an hour in 1999, a decline of 28 percent. By contrast, the earnings of workers with an advanced degree (beyond college) increased by more than 20 percent during the same period (Krueger 2003, 4). A given educational achievement gap between two individuals leads to a larger earnings gap today than it did in the past. This trend has been particularly disadvantageous for race-ethnic groups such as African Americans and Latinos, whose academic achievement has historically lagged behind that of whites. At the same time, it has benefited Asians, whose academic achievement has equaled and in some areas surpassed that of whites. The great importance of racial-ethnic academic achievement gaps for understanding racial-ethnic earnings gaps is illustrated by the finding that the earnings gap between African American and white men can be fully explained by a calculation that accounts for, among other variables, the educational credentials (years of schooling completed) and cognitive skills (test score) gaps between these groups. Here, the 40 percent of the black-white hourly wage gap accounted for by the cognitive skills gap is four times the size of the portion accounted for by the credentials gap (Farkas and Vicknair 1996, table 1). Thus, the study of racial-ethnic gaps in academic achievement-test scores and credentials-is central to understanding poverty and income differentials across these groups in America today. Approximately fifty years after the Brown decision, forty years after the Coleman report, and during a period of intense discussion of No Child Left Behind, concern with these gaps is hardly new. What is new is recent evidence on the timing and sources of these disparities in the early lives and school careers of children, an example of which is presented in figure 5.1 (originally published in Farkas and Beron 2004). This shows typical growth profiles of oral vocabulary knowledge from three to thirteen years of age for four groups of children-whites and blacks from low and high socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. These have been calculated from a regression analysis that separated the effects of race and SES on both the starting value (score at three years) and growth rate of vocabulary knowledge from three to thirteen. The results show that race and SES each have a distinct effect on oral vocabulary knowledge, with much of these effects occurring before age three. That is, by thirty-six months of age, for two children of otherwise identical SES, the white child has significantly greater oral vocabulary knowledge, and for two children of the same race-ethnicity, the higher SES child has a significantly larger vocabulary, with these effects being of roughly similar magnitude. Thus, the three-year vocabulary knowledge of a lower SES white child is similar to that of a higher SES black child, and the vocabulary gap between a higher SES white child and a lower SES black child is large indeed. The overall effect on white-black differences is increased by the fact that white children tend to be concentrated toward higher SES values, while black children cluster toward lower SES values. Further, these race and SES vocabulary gaps observed at age three remain essentially unchanged through to age thirteen. That is, distinct class and race gaps in oral vocabulary knowledge-a powerful predictor of success in reading and academics generally (Whitehurst and Lonigan 2002; Durham et al. 2007)-date back to before children reach their third birthday. By contrast, until recently, most nationally representative datasets focused on high school students, at ages beyond the right-hand edge of figure 5.1. Now, however, that data are available covering preschool (the left side of figure 5.1) and elementary school (the middle portion of figure 5.1), we are learning that the roots of unequal outcomes in high school are found in the preschool and early elementary years. The resulting new understanding of the early development of race-ethnic and SES inequalities in educational achievement is the focus of this chapter. © 2008 by Russell Sage Foundation.

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between individual/family and neighborhood socioeconomic distress, pain, and functional outcomes in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that both individual economic distress as well as residence in neighborhoods of severe economic distress would predict children's level of pain-related functional disability and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Participants (mean age, 12.14 years; 57% male, n = 56) were recruited from an outpatient hematology clinic at a Midwestern tertiary referral hospital. Questionnaires assessing pain, depression, functional disability, and HRQOL were completed by children and their caregivers. Individual socioeconomic data including parental education and family income were reported by caregivers. Neighborhood socioeconomic distress was identified using publicly available census tract data and was based on neighborhood poverty, female head of household, male unemployment, and high school dropout levels. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that individual/family socioeconomic distress was a significant predictor of children's functional disability and physical and psychosocial HRQOL. Neighborhood socioeconomic distress emerged as a significant independent predictor of physical HRQOL only, where living in a distressed neighborhood predicted diminished physical HRQOL. Findings suggest that individual socioeconomic status and neighborhood economic distress play similar but independent roles in predicting children's functional outcomes related to SCD pain. Perspective: Little is known about the influence of either individual/family or neighborhood socioeconomic factors on pain and functioning in children with SCD. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic distress defined at both the individual level and at the neighborhood/community level are significant independent predictors of pain-related disability and HRQOL in children with SCD. © 2008 American Pain Society.},

abstract={In Argentina adolescent pregnancy is still regarded as a public health problem or a "social epidemic". However, it is necessary to ask from which perspective and for whom it is a problem, and what type of problem. This article presents the findings of a large quantitative and qualitative study conducted in five Northern provinces and two metropolitan areas of Argentina in 2003-2004. Based on the results of a survey of adolescent mothers (n=1,645) and ten focus group discussions with adolescent girls and boys, it addresses the connections between school dropout, pregnancy and poverty, and makes recommendations on how to tailor health care and sexuality education to address local realities. The findings indicate a need to develop educational activities to promote safer sex and address gender power relations in programmes working with deprived communities. Sexuality education with a gender and rights perspective, and increasing accessibility to contraceptive methods for adolescent girls and boys is also crucial. Antenatal and post-partum care, as well as post-abortion care, should be improved for young women and viewed as opportunities for contraceptive counselling and provision. Male participation in pregnancy prevention and care also needs to be promoted. © 2008 Reproductive Health Matters.},

abstract={The authors tested a theoretical model positing that poverty has an indirect effect on child and adolescent functioning through children's poverty-related stress. Path analyses with a multiethnic sample of 164 children aged 6 to 18 revealed that the stress associated with poverty, such as economic strain, family conflict, violence/trauma, and discrimination, is an important component of the experience of poverty for children. Poverty-related stress was associated with a wide range of correlates, including internalizing and externalizing syndromes, DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms, physical health, and deviant behavior such as pregnancy, legal problems, substance abuse, and school dropout. Most models fit equally well for adolescents and preadolescents, suggesting that poverty is stressful for children as young as 6. African American children's functioning was less strongly associated with poverty-related stress than was the functioning of Hispanic and Caucasian children. Implications of poverty-related stress as a potential mechanism of poverty's pernicious effect on child functioning are discussed.},

abstract={Absenteeism from school is a serious public health issue for mental health professionals, physicians, and educators. The prevalence of unexcused absences from school exceeds that of major childhood behavior disorders and is a key risk factor for violence, injury, substance use, psychiatric disorders, and economic deprivation. This article involves a contemporary research review on absenteeism prevalence, comorbid physical and psychiatric conditions, classification, contextual risk factors, cross-cultural variables, assessment, intervention, and outcome. Contextual risk factors include homelessness and poverty, teenage pregnancy, school violence and victimization, school climate and connectedness, parental involvement, and family variables, among others. A description of intervention includes medical, clinical, and systemic interventions. Medical professionals, community- and school-based mental health professionals, and educators are encouraged to fully understand the parameters of school absenteeism to develop better, consensual policies regarding definition, classification, assessment, and intervention of youths with problematic school absenteeism. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The chapters in this volume are part of a burgeoning research literature that studies the social and economic effects of imprisonment. Earlier work on the effects of incarceration focused on the recidivism of those coming out of prison and jail. Recent research, however, also examines how imprisonment affects the socioeconomic life of prisoners and the poor urban communities to which they return (for example, Braman 2003; Western 2006; Clear, forthcoming; Wacquant, forthcoming). New research on the social consequences of incarceration is motivated by the facts of mass imprisonment. The American incarceration rate-historically high by U.S. standards, surpassing that of some former Soviet republics, and an order of magnitude higher than in the affluent democracies of Western Europe-is a vivid symbol of social inequality. For young male high school dropouts, particularly African Americans, imprisonment has become a routine life event. A young black man born in the late 1960s is more likely to have a prison record than a bachelor's degree, and over half of young black male dropouts born in the late 1960s will go to prison at some point their lives (Pettit and Western 2004). Statistics like these have focused the attention of students of poverty, race, and urban problems on the penal system as a novel feature of a distinctively American pattern of social inequality. Research on the social impact of incarceration suggests that policy has a role, not just in reducing crime but in improving the economic and family life of those drawn into the penal system. Policies designed to repair the economic and family life of ex-prisoners serve several goals. First, steady work and a stable family are keys to desistance from crime (Sampson and Laub 1993; Uggen 2000; Warr 1998). A good job provides structure to daily life, draws a man out of his peer networks that form the context for criminal offending, and offers a wage, which weakens the temptations of an illegal income. Beyond the effects on crime, policies that smooth the reentry of ex-offenders into their homes and jobs may have large redistributive effects. Because incarceration rates are now so high among young men with little schooling, measures that improve employment and family life among ex-prisoners may also raise the economic standing of those at the bottom of American society. In the era of mass imprisonment, social supports for ex-prisoners provide new tools for reducing poverty. The papers in this volume study the links between the penal system and the American labor market. In this chapter I connect this research on prisons and the labor market to policies that can help ex-prisoners find work after coming out of prison. Copyright © 2007 by Russell Sage Foundation.

abstract={The incontrovertible scientific evidence about tobacco use causing serious health consequences is now accepted even by the tobacco industry. Research continues to enlarge the spectrum of diseases caused by tobacco use among users as well as among nonusers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. This review attempts to illustrate the greater risk to adverse health outcomes among the less educated due to a greater prevalence of tobacco use among them. Numerous surveys worldwide and in India show a greater prevalence of tobacco use among the less educated and illiterate. In a large population based study in Mumbai, the odds ratios for any kind of tobacco use among the illiterate as compared to the college educated were 7.4 for males and 20.3 for females after adjusting for age and occupation. School-dropouts are more likely to take up tobacco use in childhood and adolescence. Student youth taught about the dangers of tobacco use in school are less likely to initiate tobacco use. High tobacco use among the less educated and under privileged affects them in multiple ways: (i) Tobacco users in such households, because of their nicotine addiction, prefer spending a disproportionate amount of their meager income on tobacco products, often curtailing essential expenditures for food, healthcare and education for the family. (ii) Because of high tobacco use and other factors of disadvantage connected with low educational status, they suffer more from the diseases and other health impacts caused by tobacco. This higher morbidity results in high health care expenditures, which impoverish the family further. (ii) Premature death caused by tobacco use in this under-privileged section often takes away the major wage earner in the family, plunging it into even more hardship. Tobacco use is a terrible scourge particularly of the less educated, globally and in India. Tobacco use, education and health in a human population are inter-related in ways that make sufferings and deaths caused by tobacco use even more tragic than normally realized. Tobacco use works against social and economic development and should be appropriately addressed through health education and tobacco cessation services particularly in the under priviledged, illiterate population.},

abstract={This chapter assesses Baby Boom retirement prospects, comparing the outlook for this cohort with experiences of previous generations. The impact of aging is assessed using the Social Security's Model of Income in the Near Term and project retirement incomes for a representative group of individuals born between 1926 and 1965. Results indicate that Baby Boomers can expect to have higher real incomes and lower poverty rates in retirement than current retirees. However, the gains in family income are not equally distributed: for instance, never-married Boomer women will be relatively better off while high school Boomer dropouts will be relatively worse off than current retirees. Boomers' post-retirement incomes are not predicted to rise as much as pre-retirement incomes. Additionally, certain population subgroups will remain economically vulnerable, including divorced women, never-married men, Hispanics, high school dropouts, those with weak labor force attachments, and those with the lowest lifetime earnings. © Pension Research Council, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 2007.

abstract={Many students of Mexican descent must learn how to be successful students. This study describes 5 students of Mexican descent from situationally marginalized lives who were a part of a support and retention scholarship program (College Assistance Migrant Program—CAMP). These case studies document how they perceived their learning and how they changed as students after their first college experience and involvement in CAMP. Through her involvement in CAMP, Laura, a high school dropout without a supportive home or school environment, came to see herself as a successful student. As an English Language Learner, Cristina felt ill-prepared to begin a college career; however, by experiencing successes in her first year of coursework and being involved in CAMP, she gained self-confidence. Maria, a teen mother with two children, saw college as the only way out of poverty. She exhibited resiliency and the desire to use the experience to gain insightful and practical knowledge about herself as a student and mother. During high school, the continual relocation between Mexico and the United States negatively affected Luz's ability to be successful. Through CAMP, she gained confidence in her ability to relate with others, particularly with teachers and professors. Ruben, a former gang member, struggled in his first semester as he acclimated to the structured environment of a classroom. Despite this struggle, the CAMP staff and his professors saw growth in Ruben's social behavior. These case studies show that students who would not normally be considered “college material,” when given the opportunity and appropriate support, can become successful. This success hinges on their new perspective of themselves and their participation in a community of practice. © 2007 Sage Publications.},

abstract={American Indian/Alaska Native well-being, survival-based data are rare. This study explores the question of whether or not it is possible to produce such well-being information using secondary data sources. The answer is yes, with some limitations. Hence, Native American data for 10 well-being indicators nationally and for New Mexico and South Dakota, using a model like Kids Count (Annie E. Casey Foundation: 2003a 2001 KIDS COUNT Data Book: State profiles of child well-being (Annie E. Casey Foundation, Baltimore, MD)) are reported; thereby reducing the gap in survival indicators for U.S. Indigenous children and youths. Comparisons between all children and American Indian children demonstrate that Native American children have comparatively worse well-being rates at the national level and in South Dakota, whereas New Mexico Native kids compare favorably to their non-Native peers. Policy recommendations conclude the paper. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

abstract={This study identifies the subgroups of domestic batterers who are at a low or high risk of failing to complete domestic batterer cognitive behavioral treatment. The sample is composed of 355 domestic batterers ordered to complete treatment, with 31.8% not completing treatment. Three subgroups of batterers were identified as having at least a 60% chance of treatment failure: (a) unemployed generalized aggressors, (b) high school dropouts ordered into substance abuse treatment, and (c) unemployed offenders ordered into substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, a high school education, even when offenders are unemployed or living in poverty, buffers the negative effects of a substance abuse problem among court-mandated batterers required to participate in both domestic violence treatment and substance abuse treatment. Two thirds of substance-abusing high school graduates completed both domestic violence and substance abuse treatment, compared to only one third of the substance-abusing high school dropouts. Implications are discussed. © 2007 Sage Publications.},

abstract={There is perhaps no more pressing issue in school policy today than the achievement gap across social lines. Achievement differences between well-to-do children and poor children and between disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities and majority whites are large when children first begin school, and they increase over time. Despite years of study and an abundance of good intentions, these patterned achievement differences persist, but who is responsible, and how are schools implicated? The increasing gap seems to suggest that schools are unable to equalize educational opportunity or, worse still, that they actively handicap disadvantaged children. But a seasonal perspective on learning yields a rather different impression. Comparing achievement gains separately over the school year and the summer months reveals that much of the achievement gap originates over the summer period, when children are not in school. The authors review Beginning School Study research on differential summer learning across social lines (that is, by family socioeconomic level) and its implications for later schooling outcomes, including high school curriculum placements, high school dropout, and college attendance. These studies document the extent to which these large summer learning differences impede the later educational progress of children of low socioeconomic status. Practical implications are discussed, including the need for early and sustained interventions to prevent the achievement gap from opening wide in the first place and for high-quality summer programming focused on preventing differential summer learning loss.},

abstract={ARANDOM-ASSIGNMENT study can provide the most compelling evidence possible about how an intervention - be it social, economic, legal, or medical - affects the people to whom it is targeted. Randomization entails using a lotterylike process to assign each eligible sample member either to a group that is offered the intervention or to a group that is not. This process ensures that the two groups are the same in every way (in statistical expectation), except that one group is assigned to the intervention and the other is not. Any statistically significant differences between the two groups that are subsequently observed can be confidently attributed to the intervention. This is why randomization, often referred to as the gold standard for studying cause-and-effect relationships, is now widely used in many fields of research. In medicine, more than 350,000 randomized clinical trials have been conducted during the last fifty years (Cochrane Collaboration 2002). In social policy, a total of more than 800,000 people were randomly assigned in two hundred twenty studies between 1962 and 1997 (Greenberg and Shroder 1997). Reflecting and reinforcing these trends, the Institute of Education Sciences was created within the U.S. Department of Education in 2002 in the belief that amassing rigorous, credible evidence about the effects of education interventions calls for randomized control trials (U.S. Department of Education 2003). The spread of randomization in social policy research has not been confined to the United States. In the developing world, the effectiveness of a variety of poverty-reduction programs, particularly ones focused on improving children's education attainment, are increasingly likely to be evaluated using random-assignment designs (see, for example, Schultz 2001). Here we refer to any study that uses random assignment as an experiment. Problems related to sample selection, randomization, and attrition can undermine experimental designs, thereby preventing researchers from drawing valid causal inferences and reducing the policy relevance of the research. Although these problems deserve careful consideration, this chapter does not address them. Key assumptions underlying the present discussion are that an experiment's random-assignment process is well designed and successfully executed and that data collection is complete (or nearly complete) for the individuals or other entities under study. But even well-realized experiments have limitations that are important to recognize if one is to interpret findings correctly and to design studies that provide the highest-quality, most policy-relevant information possible. We briefly review these limitations before introducing the methodological approach that is the centerpiece of this chapter. First, even when random assignment is feasible, full compliance with its outcome usually cannot be assured. For example, one can randomize the offer of a new medical treatment to patients afflicted with a particular type of cancer, but one cannot guarantee full randomization of its receipt without forcing some patients to accept it against their will, which is unethical. Similarly, one can randomize the offer of subsidized child care for low-income families, but one cannot guarantee full randomization of its use because families have the right to choose their children's care. And one can randomize the offer of an education voucher that enables people to move their children to a better school, but one cannot randomize such moves without encountering tremendous political resistance. This limitation of the experimental approach is often not fully appreciated or understood. The questions at its heart - namely, who has the opportunity to take advantage of an offered treatment and who actually takes advantage of it - are fundamentally different from the question of what dosage of the treatment is offered. A second limitation of experimental research is that it can be used to study only interventions to which entities can be randomly assigned. Because randomization is sometimes impossible or unacceptable, many important questions cannot be directly addressed using the experimental approach. To take a clear-cut example, the effects of birth parents' demographic characteristics on their children cannot be studied by randomly assigning children to parents or parents to children. Finally, although experiments are the most powerful known way to assess the causal effects of an intervention on an outcome, they do not by themselves provide much insight into how these effects are brought about. This issue is particularly important for interventions that consist of numerous components, any combination of which might be responsible for an observed effect. For example, testing a multifaceted reading curriculum by randomly assigning each member of a sample of firstgrade students to a group that is exposed to the new curriculum or to a group that is not is an excellent way to measure any subsequent changes in reading achievement caused by the curriculum (relative to the curriculum to which students would have otherwise been exposed). However, without more information, additional assumptions, or both, the experiment will not provide compelling evidence about how or why the curriculum does or does not improve reading achievement or about the relative effectiveness of its various components. This limitation of the experimental paradigm is often referred to as the "black box" problem. Simply put, the problem is that experiments are good at documenting the linkages, or the lack thereof, between an intervention (the input to the black box) and outcomes (the output of the black box), but they provide little or no direct information about why the intervention did or not did affect the outcome. The goal of this chapter is to present an analytic approach that combines randomized experiments with a well-known nonexperimental method from econometrics called instrumental-variables estimation. Although coupling the instrumental-variables approach with experimental data is not new, we extend it to enable researchers to address questions about how the outcomes observed in an experiment might have been affected by multiple factors associated with the treatment. As discussed in the literature review that follows, the technique holds promise as a way to mitigate the three limitations of experimental research already noted. Appropriately used, the instrumental-variables approach can broaden the range of policy issues that can be effectively addressed to include questions such as the following: What is the effect of taking small daily doses of aspirin on the incidence and severity of future heart attacks among men over fifty? What is the effect of serving in the military on the future earnings of people who render military service during wartime? What is the effect of families' moving from an impoverished neighborhood to a better-off neighborhood on the future criminal behavior of their adolescent children? What is the effect of attending job training on the future earnings of young school dropouts? What are the effects on children of policy-induced increases in their parents' future earnings and income? In the next section of this chapter, we lay out a conceptual and statistical framework that will allow us to describe the limits of experimental evidence (even in well-realized random assignment designs), illustrate how research analysis can be extended beyond these limits, and delineate the conditions under which such extension is possible. To introduce the framework, we present and discuss a series of effect estimators that may be used to answer different policy questions of interest. These estimators form the foundation of the instrumental-variables analysis presented in the third section of the chapter, in which we illustrate how the technique can be applied to experimental data to explore the causal paths by which an intervention produces its observed effects. In the concluding section, we reflect on the potential of the instrumental variables approach and the conditions necessary for its success. Copyright © 2005 by Russell Sage Foundation.

abstract={Human behavior is dynamic, influenced by changing situations over time. Yet the impact of the dynamic nature of important explanatory variables on outcomes has only recently begun to be estimated in developmental models. Using a risk factor perspective, this article demonstrates the potential benefits of regressing time-varying outcome measures on time-varying explanatory measures in longitudinal models. The authors apply event history analysis techniques to demonstrate a methodological strategy that accounts for changes over time in two family risk factors for high school graduation. In a sample of 686 low-income youth attending school in an urban district, the authors found that maternal employment status and income are significant predictors of high school graduation only when conceptualized and measured as time-varying influences. The implications for policy and practice and, from a methodological perspective, for the use of time-varying explanatory variables in event models are discussed. © 2006 Sage Publications.},

abstract={This article investigates the extent to which state-mandated high school exit examinations are associated with state-level public high school completion rates in the United States. The authors estimate a series of state and year fixed effects models using a new measure of state-level public high school completion rates and archival information about states ' policies on high school exit examinations from 1975 through 2002. The study finds that state high school exit examinations - particularly the "more difficult" examinations that have been implemented recently in some states - are associated with lower public high school completion rates and higher rates of General Educational Development test taking. Furthermore, the study finds that the association between state policies on high school exit examinations and public high school completion grows stronger as states become more racially and ethnically diverse and as poverty rates increase.},

abstract={Guided by human capital, socialization, and institutionalization theories, this study examined mid-life health and economic well-being of General Education Development (GED) certificate recipients. Relying on a study sample (N = 1,927) obtained from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, GED recipients were found to have worse mid-life outcomes than conventional high school graduates on measures of family income and depression and to have better mid-life outcomes than high school dropouts on measures of assets, family income, depression, and self-reported physical illnesses. Findings suggested that GED recipients should not be unnecessarily lumped together with high school graduates and that programs and services targeting potential and subsequent GED recipients and high school dropouts to remain in school might not only improve their mid-life labor market and economic outcomes, but also their physical and mental health. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={According to the American dream, hard work and a good education can lift people from poverty to success in the "land of opportunity." The unskilled immigrants who came to the United States from southern, central, and eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries largely realized that vision. Within a few generations, their descendants rose to the middle class and beyond. But can today's unskilled immigrant arrivals-especially Mexicans, the nation's most numerous immigrant group-expect to achieve the same for their descendants? Social scientists disagree on this question, basing their arguments primarily on how well contemporary arrivals are faring. In Italians Then, Mexicans Now, Joel Perlmann uses the latest immigration data as well as 100 years of historical census data to compare the progress of unskilled immigrants and their American-born children both then and now. The crucial difference between the immigrant experience a hundred years ago and today is that relatively well-paid jobs were plentiful for workers with little education a hundred years ago, while today's immigrants arrive in an increasingly unequal America. Perlmann finds that while this change over time is real, its impact has not been as strong as many scholars have argued. In particular, these changes have not been great enough to force today's Mexican second generation into an inner-city "underclass." Perlmann emphasizes that high school dropout rates among second-generation Mexicans are alarmingly high, and are likely to have a strong impact on the group's well-being. Yet despite their high dropout rates, Mexican Americans earn at least as much as African Americans, and they fare better on social measures such as unwed childbearing and incarceration, which often lead to economic hardship. Perlmann concludes that inter-generational progress, though likely to be slower than it was for the European immigrants a century ago, is a reality, and could be enhanced if policy interventions are taken to boost high school graduation rates for Mexican children. Rich with historical data, Italians Then, Mexicans Now persuasively argues that today's Mexican immigrants are making slow but steady socio-economic progress and may one day reach parity with earlier immigrant groups who moved up into the heart of the American middle class.

abstract={Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) has been linked to a wide variety of adverse psychological and behavioral outcomes. This paper describes girls' sexual development in the inner city based on qualitative material from a long-term ethnographic (observational) study. For many inner-city girls, early and then continued experiences of being compelled to have sex were found to be part of a pathway leading to independent sexuality that often involved prostitution, teen pregnancy, early motherhood, school dropout, limited involvement with jobs, drug abuse, multiple children by different fathers and single-parent families. Quotes from respondents illustrate the mechanics of this process and how it is sustained by the deprivations of structural disadvantage, prevailing subcultural norms, violence and illicit drug use. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Two studies were conducted to explore the degree to which single- and multiple-risk profiles were evident in samples of African American early adolescents in low-income inner-city, rural, and suburban schools. Study 1 examined early adolescent risk status (i.e., single, multiple) in relation to later adjustment in a representative sample (70% European American, 30% African American). Youth who experienced a single risk in early adolescence had moderately increased levels of school dropout and criminal arrests, whereas youth with multiple risks (i.e., combination of 2 or more risks) had significantly increased levels of school dropout, criminal arrests, and teen parenthood. Study 2 examined the extent to which single- and multiple-risk profiles were evident in cross-sectional samples of African American youth from low-income inner-city and rural areas. About one fourth of both the inner-city and rural samples of African American youth were composed of youth in the single-risk category. A significantly greater proportion of boys in the inner-city sample (20%) than boys in the rural sample (13%) experienced multiple risks. Girls across the rural and inner-city samples did not differ in terms of risk. Overall, more than 60% of African American youth in these two low-income samples did not evidence risk for later adjustment problems. Implications for research and intervention are discussed.},

abstract={Children characterized as “high risk” constitute one of the most formidable problems of the 21st-century educational system. By “high risk” we refer to children who are immersed in everyday realities characterized by issues such as child abuse, child poverty, teen suicide, teen drug abuse, high school dropout rates, unemployment, limited or no health insurance coverage, food insecurities, and income inequality (Institute for Innovation in Social Policy, 2010). In this chapter, we contend that high-risk Native American children underperform in school, in large part, because their relationship with education is fraught with social, cultural, and historical difficulties (e.g., cultural mismatches, discrimination, historical cycles of low expectations and underperformance) and because attempts to solve these issues have been largely reactive and limited in scope. The difficulties Native American children experience in education, for example, are too often explained by mainstream, individualist explanations for underperformance. Native students are seen as either not motivated and/or cognitively less skilled, or their home and community contexts are viewed as not adequately fostering positive development. These simple cause-and-effect explanations ignore the fact that history is replete with examples of the ways in which inequality and racism toward Native Americans have been and continue to be fostered by mainstream cultural ideas and practices (Winant, 2004). The legacy of education in the United States, for instance, includes the forced removal of Native American children from their families and placement in government-run boarding schools (Adams, 1988, 1995), which has had a number of pernicious long-term effects on the adaptation of formal, mainstream education in tribal communities (Kawamoto, 2001; Lomawaima & McCarty, 2006). © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

abstract={Transkei is a former black homeland in South Africa with high illiteracy, unemployment, and poverty. The crime rate is high. Multiple sexual relationships are common. Risky sexual behavior among teenagers and young adults is rife. This report presents case histories of nine teenagers and young adults who committed suicide in 2000 and 2001. Some common underlying causes have been identified and discussed. Among them sexual matters and family disharmony were featured prominently. Broken families, alcohol, and financial difficulties are also contributory. Majority of the victims were learners or school dropouts. Only one was employed. The author has analyzed the cases and has tried to ascertain the underlying reasons for suicide.},

abstract={While educational success in high school can be linked to elementary school achievement, there is little evidence that parent involvement in elementary school provides lasting benefits to children through high school. Using data from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, this study investigated the association between parent involvement in elementary school and success in high school. Parent involvement in school (based on teacher and parent reports) and parent reports of home involvement were used to determine if greater reported parent involvement was associated with indicators of school success. Results indicated that even after controlling for background characteristics and risk factors, parent involvement in school was significantly associated with lower rates of high school dropout, increased on-time high school completion, and highest grade completed. This study suggests that parent involvement in school is an important component in early childhood education to help promote long-term effects. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Central goals of system-of-care initiatives for children and families have been to decrease the use of restrictive services while increasing the use of community-based resources. However, the menu of appropriate community services must in part be based on characteristics of children and families presenting within a particular community and may differ by urban and nonurban residence. The present study aimed to compare characteristics of child and adolescent clients from urban and nonurban communities in an attempt to begin to inform the development of appropriate community programming. Using intake data from all referrals to the 23 systems of care in Connecticut from July 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002, comparisons were made between youth from urban and nonurban areas. Analyses demonstrated lower rates of bipolar disorder, hospital and foster-home placement and higher levels of caregiver-reported intrapersonal strength and general child functioning among urban compared to nonurban youth. That these differences could not be attributed to correlates of urban residence, such as income, ethnicity, child poverty, high school dropout rates, and crowding, suggests the possibility that as yet unexamined variables might mitigate these risk factors. The continued examination of group differences meant to inform this important issue is warranted.},

abstract={Today, one quarter of all families and six of every ten black families are lone-parent families, and most of these lone parents are never-married mothers. One half of all marriages end in divorce and only one half of divorced fathers make the payments that they owe by law to support their children. If current trends continue, one half of the children in the United States will experience at least part of their childhoods in lone-parent families (Luker 1998). The decline of the married-parent family is a controversial topic, one that has been featured in political debates about "family values." According to one observer, Ever since the growth of the one-parent family, there has been a tendency to accept it as virtually normal. Too many social commentators portray the birth of children out of wedlock as part of the "norm." What actually amounts to abandoning children, usually by the father, is becoming increasingly acceptable without penalty to anyone except to the neglected child. Too many social scientists and policymakers play down the advantages of the two-parent family; some even ridicule it as an outmoded middle-class ideal. (Hechinger 1992) One reason for concern about the sharp decline in the marriage rate is that children living in one-parent families in the United States, especially those in families where the parent has never married, suffer from many more disadvantages than those in married-parent families. "Families with multiple earners rise toward the top of the family income distribution, while families with just one earner fall toward the bottom," states the University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith (1998, 12). "As the number of single-headed households rises, so too will inequality. This pattern is compounded in the real world by the grim fact that single-headed households also comprise, to a large extent, those with the most unstable employment experiences at the lowest wages." Children living in households headed by single mothers are the poorest demographic group in the nation. Whereas only one tenth of children in husband-wife families are living below the poverty line, over one third of those living with divorced mothers and two thirds living with mothers who had never married are classified as poor. Finally, mothers who had never been married are more likely to receive welfare or public assistance for a significantly longer period than do separated or divorced mothers. In addition to the strong links between single parenthood and poverty and welfare receipt, the available research indicates that children from mother-only households are more likely to be school dropouts, to receive lower earnings in young adulthood, and to be recipients of welfare. Moreover, daughters who have grown up in black single-parent households are more likely to establish single-parent households themselves than are those who have been raised in married-couple households. Furthermore, single-parent households tend to exert less control over the behavior of adolescents. Reviewing their research findings, Sanford Dornbusch and his colleagues (1985, 340) concluded: We do not know whether it is lack of surveillance, lack of appropriate teaching, or lack of social support for the single parent that leads to a reduction in control of adolescents, especially males, in mother-only families. But we do know, and perhaps this has broad implications, that the presence of any other adult in a mother-only household brings control levels closer to those found in two-parent families⋯ and that the raising of adolescents is not a task that can be borne by a mother alone. Many factors are involved in the precipitous decline in marriage rates and the sharp rise in lone-parent families since the 1970s. The explanation most often heard in the public debate associates the increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births and single-parent families with welfare. Indeed, it is widely assumed among the general public that a direct causal connection exists between the level of welfare benefits and the likelihood that a young woman will bear a child outside marriage, and this assumption is reflected in the many recent proposals for welfare reform. However, the scientific evidence offers little support for the claim that AFDC benefits played a significant role in promoting out-of-wedlock births. Research examining the association between the generosity of welfare benefits and out-of-wedlock childbearing and teen pregnancy indicates that benefit levels have no significant effect on the likelihood that African American girls and women will have children outside marriage; likewise, welfare rates have either no significant effect or only a small effect on the odds that whites will have children outside marriage. There is no evidence to suggest that welfare is a major factor in the rise of childbearing outside marriage (see, for example, Duncan 1994; Duncan and Hoffman 1990; and Bane and Ellwood 1983). The rate of out-of-wedlock teen childbearing nearly doubled between 1975 and 1995, despite the fact that during the period the real value of AFDC, food stamps, and Medicaid fell, if one adjusts for inflation. Furthermore, the smallest increases in the number of out-of-wedlock births did not occur in the states that had the largest declines in the inflation-adjusted value of AFDC benefits (Duncan 1994). Indeed, while the real value of cash welfare benefits plummeted between 1975 and 1995, not only did out-of-wedlock child-bearing increase, but also postpartum marriages (marriages following the birth of a couple's child) decreased.

abstract={This study merged two theoretical constructs: cumulative risk and allostatic load. Physical (crowding, noise, housing quality) and psychosocial (child separation, turmoil, violence) aspects of the home environment and personal characteristics (poverty, single parenthood, maternal high school dropout status) were modeled in a cumulative risk heuristic. Elevated cumulative risk was associated with heightened cardiovascular and neuroendocrine parameters, increased deposition of body fat, and a higher summary index of total allostatic load. Previous findings that children who face more cumulative risk have greater psychological distress were replicated among a sample of rural children and shown to generalize to lower perceptions of self-worth. Prior cumulative risk research was further extended through demonstration of self-regulatory behavior problems and elevated learned helplessness.},

abstract={This book presents ten alarmingly candid interviews by some of the most prominent members of what co-editors Carol M. Swain and Russ Nieli warn is a growing White Nationalist movement. The ten people interviewed in this volume make statements that are sure to shock, amuse, challenge, and provoke readers. Their remarks are of particular interest, Swain and Nieli believe, for understanding how the many race-conscious whites who lie outside the integrationist consensus on racial issues in America view developments that have taken place in the United States since the Civil Rights movement. If current trends continue, the authors predict, these ideas will become more common, especially as whites become a diminishing portion of the U.S. population. They argue that the claims of white nationalists need to be aired in open, public forums, where they can be vigorously challenged and subjected to refutation. Carol M. Swain is Professor of Political Science and Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University. She is the author of Black Faces, Black Interests (Harvard, 1993). She has published numerous articles including the op-eds in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Chronicle of Higher Education and lectures widely across the country, on issues ranging from congressional redistricting to the future of affirmative action programs. Swain was one of twelve children born into rural poverty, is a high school dropout, and a first generation college student who started her education at a community college and went on to receive a doctorate and law degree. She spent the first ten years of her career teaching at Princeton University, where she was a tenured professor of political science and public policy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. A former Fulbright Scholar, Russ Nieli is currently a lecturer in politics at Princeton University. His areas of academic interest run the gammet from Wittgenstein to race relations, and he is currently working on a book on the decline of the inner-city African American communities in the decades following the Civil Rights Revolution of the 1960's. © Carol M. Swain and Russ Nieli 2003 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.},

abstract={Although a substantial body of recent research has examined the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic distress on youth socioeconomic attainment and urban social dislocations, few studies have determined under what conditions, and for what types of adolescents, neighborhood characteristics matter most. Drawing on theories of collective socialization, social capital, and social control, we develop hypotheses regarding the conditional nature of neighborhood effects on the risk of dropping out of high school, and we then test these hypotheses by estimating event history models based on data from the 1968-1993 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that, among African Americans, the detrimental impact of neighborhood socioeconomic distress on school dropout has increased significantly over the past quarter-century, a probable repercussion of the increasing geographic concentration of urban poverty. The negative effect of neighborhood distress on high school completion is particularly pronounced among black adolescents from single-parent households and among white adolescents from low-income families, results broadly consistent with Wilson's claim that exposure to neighborhood poverty reinforces the damaging consequences of individual disadvantage. Supporting the social capital perspective, among both black and white adolescents the deleterious impact of neighborhood distress on school dropout is stronger for recent in-movers than for long-term residents. The impact of neighborhood disadvantage also varies significantly by gender for both racial groups and, among whites, is stronger for younger than older adolescents. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for theories of neighborhood effects. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Problem: Various demographic and community characteristics are associated with child abuse rates in national and urban samples, but similar analyses have not been done within rural areas. This study analyzes the relationships between reported and substantiated rates of child abuse and county demographic, health care resource and social services factors in a predominantly rural state in the US. Methods: County-level data from Iowa between 1984-1993 were analyzed for associations between county characteristics and rates of child abuse using univariate correlations and multivariate stagewise regression analysis. Population-adjusted rates of reported and substantiated child abuse were correlated with rates of children in poverty, single-parent families, marriage and divorce, unemployment, high-school dropouts, median family income, elder abuse, birth and death rates, numbers of physicians and other healthcare providers, hospital, social workers, and number of caseworkers in the Department of Human Services. Results: Rates of single-parent families, divorce and elder abuse were significantly associated with reported and substantiated child abuse in multivariate analysis, while economic and most health care factors were not. Reporting and substantiation rates differed across districts after adjustment for multiple factors including caseworker workload. Conclusions: In this rural state, family structure is more significantly associated with child abuse report and substantiation rates than are socioeconomic factors. The level of health care resources in a county does not appear to affect these rates. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Offspring of depressed women have high rates of depressive symptoms and other psychopathology. The authors examined the relationship of mothers' symptoms of depression and anxiety reported during their offspring's childhood and adolescence on depressive disorder and educational achievement of their adult children. Method: The data come from a longitudinal cohort study of first graders from Woodlawn, a neighborhood in Chicago, followed from age 6 to 32 years (N = 879). Adult children's depression and educational attainment are regressed on earlier self-reports of mothers' psychological distress. Using multiple logistic regression, the authors controlled for the relationships of poverty, mothers' education, mobility, family structure, mothers' illness, and children's first grade classroom behavior and psychological symptoms. Results: Daughters of mothers with persistent maternal psychological distress had two and a half times the risk of lifetime depressive disorder, but no increased risk of high school dropout. For sons, mothers' psychological distress was not related to depression but was related to poorer educational attainment. Conclusions: Mothers' depressed feelings during the childrearing years relate to their children's depression and educational attainment as measured in adulthood. The patterns differ for sons and daughters.},

abstract={There is a serious substance abuse problem in the Hispanic/Latino population in the United States especially in such urban areas as Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey. Since heroin is one of the primary drugs of choice, there is also a high rate of HIV transmission through the sharing of contaminated drug paraphernalia. In addition to drag abuse, there are high rates of crime, unemployment, and early high school dropout. Cultural barriers and poverty interfere with access to appropriate healthcare and drag treatment programs. The predominant residential modality for treating addictions from Chile to China is the therapeutic community. The therapeutic community is a milieu type of therapy that utilizes peer counselors (frequently "graduates" of the program), group pressure, and rational authority figures in a functional "family" setting. Transgressions and irrational thinking are frequently met with abrasive challenges. In an effort to respond to cultural needs, CURA, a Hispanic/Latino program, focuses on "respeto," "dignidad," and "confianza." In order to assess the success rate of this orientation, an archival study was conducted using data from CURA's residential programs in 1998 and 1999. The retention rates for both clients (50-80 percent) and staff (over 90 percent) are very impressive, far above traditional "graduation" rates (20 percent) for similarly located traditional therapeutic communities. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Latina students have the highest high school dropout rate of all racial and ethnic groups. This article has three objectives: provide a brief overview of educational trends for Latina students, discuss factors associated with their educational trajectory and suggest strategies for change based on best practice wisdom. Results show that academic disparities between Latina students and other racial/ethnic female students begin as early as kindergarten and remain through age 17; achievement is compromised by a variety of factors, including family responsibilities, family poverty, lack of participation in preschool, attendance at poor quality elementary and high schools, placement into lower-track classes, poor self-image, limited neighborhood resources, lack of presence of role models and gender role attitudes. These disparities contribute to psychosocial issues and are not directly associated with Latino cultural assets, as Latino cultural capital has not been easily translated into social capital in U.S. society. Economic and social change must precede educational change if academic disparities between Latinas and other racial and ethnic girls are to be decreased. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={This paper chronicles the strides made in PK-12 geography education in Louisiana in the last decade through efforts of the Louisiana Geography Education Alliance (LaGEA) and the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities (LEH). Even though Geography is not a mandatory stand-alone subject for the curriculum and assessment, the state Department of Education recognizes the discipline by embedding it in social studies. The status of geography is presented against the backdrop of socio-economic conditions in Louisiana which stifle delivery of standards-based education in especially improverished metropolitan statistical areas and delta parishes. Conditions include: rural and urban poverty, high-school dropout rates, meager state expenditure on PK-12 education, and the regional north-south dichotomy within the state. The paper concludes that despite the initiatives of LaGEA and LEH, Geography remains a stepchild in Louisiana public schools. During the last decade a fairly solid geography education foundation has been laid. In the next century it is hoped that Geography would not simply remain on the Department of Education radar screen but that it would take its honored place in curricular and assessment policies. For that to transpire Geography educators at all levels will have to mount a more concerted and vocal public relations campaign.},

abstract={Because most youth are enrolled in school for many years before they initiate sex and when they initiate sex, schools have the potential for reducing adolescent sexual risk-taking. This paper reviews studies which examine the impact upon sexual risk-taking of school involvement, school characteristics, specific programs in school that do not address sexual behavior, and specific programs that do address sexual risk-taking. Multiple studies support several conclusions. First, involvement in and attachment to school and plans to attend higher education are all related to less sexual risk-taking and lower pregnancy rates. Second, students in schools with manifestations of poverty and disorganization are more likely to become pregnant. Third, some school programs specifically designed to increase attachment to school or reduce school dropout effectively delayed sex or reduced pregnancy rate, even when they may not address sexuality. Fourth, sex and HIV education programs do not increase sexual behavior, and some programs decrease sexual activity and increase condom or contraceptive use. Fifth, school-based clinics and school condom-availability programs do not increase sexual activity, and either may or may not increase condom or contraceptive use. Other studies reveal that there is very broad support for comprehensive sexand HIV-education programs, and accordingly, most youth receive some amount of sex or HIV education. However, important topics are not covered in many schools.},

abstract={Context: Most studies of the long-term effects of early childhood educational interventions are of demonstration programs rather than large-scale public programs. Previous studies of one of the oldest federally funded preschool programs have reported positive effects on school performance, but effects on educational attainment and crime are unknown. Objective: To determine the long-term effectiveness of a federal center-based pre-school and school - based intervention program for urban low-income children. Design, Setting, and Participants: Fifteen-year follow-up of a nonrandomized, matched-group cohort of 1539 low-income, mostly black children born in 1980 and enrolled in alternative early childhood programs in 25 sites in Chicago, Ill. Interventions: The Chicago Child-Parent Center (CPC) Program (n=989 children) provides comprehensive education, family, and health services and includes half-day pre-school at ages 3 to 4 years, half- or full-day kindergarten, and school-age services in linked elementary schools at ages 6 to 9 years. The comparison group (n=550) consisted of children who participated in alternative early childhood programs (full-day kindergarten): 374 in the preschool comparison group from 5 randomly selected schools plus 2 others that provided full-day kindergarten and additional instructional resources and 176 who attended full-day kindergartens in 6 CPCs without preschool participation. Main Outcome Measures: Rates of high school completion and school dropout by age 20 years, juvenile arrests for violent and nonviolent offenses, and grade retention and special education placement by age 18 years. Results: Relative to the preschool comparison group and adjusted for several covariates, children who participated in the preschool intervention for 1 or 2 years had a higher rate of high school completion (49.7% vs 38.5%; P=.01); more years of completed education (10.6 vs 10.2; P=.03); and lower rates of juvenile arrest (16.9% vs 25.1%; P=.003), violent arrests (9.0% vs 15.3%; P=.002), and school dropout (46.7% vs 55.0%; P=.047). Both preschool and school-age participation were significantly associated with lower rates of grade retention and special education services. The effects of preschool participation on educational attainment were greater for boys than girls, especially in reducing school dropout rates (P=.03). Relative to less extensive participation, children with extended program participation from preschool through second or third grade also experienced lower rates of grade retention (21.9% vs 32.3%; P=.001) and special education (13.5% vs 20.7%; P=.004). Conclusions: Participation in an established early childhood intervention for low-income children was associated with better educational and social outcomes up to age 20 years. These findings are among the strongest evidence that established programs administered through public schools can promote children's long-term success. © 2001 American Medical Association.},

abstract={The “Asian economic crisis” brought with it horrendous social consequences in Korea such as mass unemployment, unparalleled rises in poverty, diminished social services, rising school dropouts, increasing suicide rates, divorce and domestic violence. The primary aim of this study is to identify policies that would ameliorate these effects on the urban poor in Korea. In order to do so, we clarify how the nature and magnitude of urban low-income households in Korea have changed since the economic crisis. After providing an overview of macroeconomic events associated with the crisis and the main links between these events and economic conditions of the urban poor, we identify the socioeconomic characteristics and changes of household income for the urban poor during the crisis periods, 1997–1999. We investigate how the IMF program has changed the lives of the low-income households by adopting regression analyses and the decomposition method. The study concludes with key policy issues that would help prevent or offset the deterioration of the urban poor in Korea. © 2001 Journal of Contemporary Asia Publishers.},
funding_text 1={tant role of the government is to support civilian movements tbat are working to enable unemployed persons to regain their ability of self-support. Civil society's methods of approach to the unemployment and homeless problem are taking some useful directions. A first direction, led by the religious circles - including Catholics, Protestants and Buddhists - is helping unemployed and homeless persons through the opening of shelters. Presently about 200 such shelters have started operations around the country with financial support from the Health and Welfare Ministry. The government should give stronger support to civil society's efforts to solve the unemployment crisis. A second direction is being led by the Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice (CCEJ) through the "Unemployed Self-support Movement." This movement will offer employment information, organize self-support efforts and provide job counseling through a nationwide system of centers for unemployed persons. It also will carry out fund-raising campaigns and monitor government unemployment policy and budget implementation.},

abstract={Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) provides an integrated approach for converging all the basic services for improved child care, early stimulation and learning, health and nutrition, water and environmental sanitation aimed at the young children, expectant and lactating mothers, other women and adolescent girls in a community. Its objectives are : To improve nutritional and health status of children of 0-6 years; to reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and school dropout; to achieve effective co-ordination amongst various departments to promote child development; to lay foundation of proper psychological,physical and social development of the child ; to enahance mother's capability to look after normal health and nutritional needs of the child. ICDS services are provided through a village based centre ie, the Anganwadi centre for the services of : Supplementary nutrition, immunisation, health check-up, referral services, treatment of minor illnesses, nutrition and health education to women, preschool education to children and supports for water supply, sanitation, etc. Several government departments and their services are co-ordinated at village, block, district, state and central levels. The Anganwadiworker is the most peripheral functionary which implements the programme services at the village/community level. In projects where able leadership has been provided, ICDS has been reported to be better. Though there are some shortcomings in ICDS, till future thrust of the programme is necessary for aiming of the upliftment of underprivileged section of the population. Operative research in various areas is suggested which can help in improving the efficiency of ICDS.},

Descriptive findings provide a longitudinal profile of students' enrollment status throughout high school. Students who had graduated or were Active in the school system at the end of the study evidenced more marked change in perceptions of social support following the transition to the ninth grade compared to Inactive students, dropouts, who evidenced little change. With respect to academic performance, while both groups evidenced declines following the transition and failed to recover sustained losses, Inactive students declined more sharply in grades and attendance. Findings are discussed in terms of the mixed support for the transitional life events perspective. In addition, study limitations and directions for future research are discussed, including variables that should be considered in research with the targeted group.},

abstract={Background: Adolescent pregnancy and parenting remain a major public concern because of their impact on maternal-child health and on the social and economic well-being of the nation. Federal welfare reform legislation has created an urgent need for community-based nursing intervention programs to improve health and social outcomes for disadvantaged adolescent mothers and to promote their self-sufficiency. Objective: To evaluate the effects of an early intervention program (EIP) that uses a public health nursing model on health and social outcomes of adolescent mothers and their children and on the quality of mother-child interaction. Methods: Pregnant adolescents referred to a county health department were randomly assigned to an experimental (EIP) or control (traditional public health nursing [TPHN]) group. The sample included 121 adolescents from predominantly minority and impoverished backgrounds who were followed from pregnancy through 6 weeks postpartum. Intense and comprehensive home visitation by public health nurses and preparation-for-motherhood classes were provided to adolescents in the EIP. Health outcomes were determined on the basis of medical record data. Other measures included maternal self-report on selected behaviors, nurse interviews, and the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS). Results: Early findings indicate reduced premature birth and low-birth-weight (LBW) rates for young mothers receiving both forms of public health nursing care. No significant differences between groups were found for infant birth weight or type of delivery. Infants in the EIP had significantly fewer total days of birth-related hospitalization and rehospitalization than those in the TPHN group during the first 6 weeks of life (x21 = 6.41; p = 0.01). Adolescents in the EIP demonstrated significantly more positive educational outcomes (e.g., lower school dropout rates) than those in the TPHN group (x21 = 6.76; p &lt; 0.009). Conclusions: The early findings of this study demonstrate that pregnant adolescents benefit from both traditional and more intense public health nursing care in terms of prenatal and perinatal outcomes. The EIP was associated with decreased infant morbidity during the first 6 weeks of life and decreased maternal school dropout. Long-term outcomes for the EIP are being evaluated.},

abstract={OBJECTIVES: To help define the relationship between elder abuse rates and counties' demographics, healthcare resources, and social service characteristics. DESIGN: County-level data from Iowa were analyzed to test the association between county characteristics and rates of elder abuse between 1984 and 1993 using univariate correlation analysis and stagewise linear regression. SETTING: Ninety-nine counties in Iowa. PARTICIPANTS: Iowa residents aged 65 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: County-level population- adjusted numbers of abused elderly, abused children, children in poverty, high school dropouts, physicians and other healthcare providers, hospital beds, social workers and caseworkers in the Department of Human Services (DHS). RESULTS: Community characteristics that had a positive association with rates of reported or substantiated elder abuse at the P < .001 level were population density, children in poverty, and reported child abuse. Lower substantiated elder abuse rates were associated at P < .05 with higher community rates of high school dropouts, number of chiropractors, and number of nurse practitioners. After adjusting for number of DHS caseworkers and reported child abuse rates (a surrogate for workload) a district effect persists for substantiated elder abuse cases (P = .002). CONCLUSION: County demographics are risk factors for reported and substantiated elder abuse. The strongest risk factor for reported elder abuse was reported child abuse. The difference in districts may reflect differences in resources and/or differing characteristics of caseworkers who substantiate elder abuse. The risk factors may reflect conditions that influence the amount of elder abuse or the detection of existing elder abuse.},

abstract={Using data from the 1999 KIDS COUNT Data Book, compiled and published by The Annie E. Casey Foundation, the most recent state figures (1996) are compared with corresponding data from 1985 to assess the trends in child well-being in each state during the decade. The 10 key indicators used to rank states are taken fro federal government statistical agencies and reflect the best data available for each of the measures. Between 1985 and 1996, child well-being improved across the country in seven of the indicators (infant mortality rate; child death rate; rate of teen death by accidents, homicide and suicide; percent of teens who are high school dropouts; percent of teens not attending school and not working; percent of children living with parents who do not have full-time, year-round employment; and percent of children living in poverty). The three areas of children's well-being that worsened during the time period were; the percent of low birth-weight babies; teen birth rate; and percent of families with children headed by a single parent. While many of America's children have experienced improvements in their well-being, there is a large number of children who have been left behind. The focus of the 1999 KIDS COUNT Date Book is on the 9.2 million children who have been identified as "high risk." These children have four or more family disadvantages that put them at greater risk of experiencing poor outcomes. These kids are not benefiting from the continuing economic boom in the 1990s. The District of Columbia, Louisiana and Mississippi had the largest share of high-risk kids, ranging from 39 to 21 percent of their respective populations, and Utah the lowest, with just 5 percent. Long-term family-centered strategies that are multi-dimensional and community-wide are recommended to help promote family change.},

abstract={In this article, we investigate the threshold-like effects of four aspects of neighborhood environment: poverty rate, adult nonemployment rate, female headship rate for families with children, and secondary school dropout rate. We used a sample consisting of virtually all census tracts from U.S. metropolitan areas. The relationship between the value of numerous neighborhood indicators in 1980 and subsequent changes in each of the four dimensions of neighborhood quality of family life from 1980 to 1990 was evaluated statistically using a regression model with a spline specification to test for non-linear, threshold-like processes. Stressing the exploratory nature of the study, we find evidence of threshold-like effects in an endodynamic relationship (poverty rate and subsequent changes in that rate), and in exodynamic relationships (occupational status and rental rates and subsequent changes in several neighborhood quality indicators). Implications for research and a spatially targeted neighborhood reinvestment policy are derived from the analysis.},
