Abstract = {{Research studies show that Europeans are increasingly less interested in
   having children, explanation being generally translated by behaviour
   changing specific to society modernization. The global economic crisis
   is an additional factor. Policymakers understood the need to elaborate
   social policies aiming to eliminate those factors which discourage
   people to have children. Family policies are part of those policies that
   can encourage parents to have children, but equally can support families
   with children who are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Based on
   these issues, the article has two parts. The first part of this paper
   presents the concept of poverty and the importance of supporting
   families to have wealthy educated children. The second part presents the
   situation of families with children of primary school age from Romania
   based on statistical data provided by UNESCO Institute for Statistics
   given the fact that, in this country, one of the main factors of school
   dropout is poverty.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined prospective associations between poverty, gender,
   and school dropout in a large community sample of South African
   adolescents (baseline: n = 3515, follow-up: n = 3401, 57\% female, age
   range at baseline: 10-17 years, mean age at baseline = 13.45). School
   dropout was defined as being enrolled in school at baseline assessment
   but no longer enrolled in school at follow-up assessment. Poverty was
   measured at baseline assessment using an index of access to the eight
   highest socially perceived necessities for South African children and
   adolescents. Demographic characteristics including child gender and age,
   province, and urban versus rural location were recorded at baseline
   assessment and controlled for in the analysis. As predicted, higher
   poverty scores (AOR = 2.01, p< .001) were associated with increased odds
   of school dropout 1 year later. Gender was not a significant predictor
   of school dropout (AOR = 1.56, p = .07) but did interact with poverty
   (AOR = 0.66, p = .04) in predicting school dropout. However, our initial
   hypothesis that the impact of poverty on school dropout would be
   stronger for girls than boys was not supported. Instead, results
   indicated that while girls were at elevated risk of school dropout at
   low and mean levels of poverty, at high levels of poverty this gender
   difference was no longer evident. Findings suggest that vulnerable boys
   should not be neglected in policies to improve retention in education in
   contexts of extreme poverty.}},

Abstract = {{The psychological well-being at school of immigrant students living in
   poverty is currently an understudied topic in developmental psychology.
   This is an important shortcoming because this population, which is
   rapidly increasing in many western countries, is in a double minority
   condition and has a greater risk of experiencing psychological distress
   at school, in comparison with their native peers. In order to improve
   our understanding on this issue, the present two-wave study investigated
   the prospective relationships between peer acceptance and two aspects of
   well-being at school-intention to drop out of school and negative
   self-esteem-specifically focusing on the differential effect of having
   (vs. not having) an immigrant background. The participants were 249
   preadolescents and adolescents living in poverty (M-age = 12.76; SDage =
   2.34; 41.8\% girls; 19.3\% immigrants) who were attending educational
   centres for disadvantaged minors. The poverty status of the participants
   was an inclusion criterion. A multilinear regression model with
   multigroup analysis was tested. As expected, the results showed that
   peer acceptance had a significant negative association with school
   dropout intentions and negative self-esteem only for immigrants, but not
   for natives. For immigrant students, the protective effect of peer
   acceptance was comparable to the stability over time of dropout
   intention and self-esteem, a result that has promising implications for
   prevention programs. The applied implications of the study for
   educational and clinical contexts are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The existing association between school dropout rates and poverty make
   this phenomenon a central element on the educational policy agenda. The
   possibility of a better future for youth in vulnerable sectors depends
   precisely on solving this problem, taking into account the importance of
   education as a social inclusion mechanism. The main objective of this
   article was to evaluate the presence and specific weight that a series
   of family factors has in contexts of primary level dropouts from a poor
   urban sector in the city of Santiago, Chile. This descriptive field
   study included applying a survey to a sample of 304 primary school
   dropouts from the sector. Results showed that the dropouts' families
   have some clear characteristics: they are numerous, monoparental and
   exhibit low educational levels and significant economic problems.
   Conclusions are that the low socioeconomic level and the existence of
   certain problems within the families translate into poor school
   performance and little parental support for their children, factors that
   can lead to dropout.}},

Abstract = {{This study tries to determine the spatial factors that explain school
   dropout risk across Tunisian delegations. The spatial exploratory
   analysis allowed us to map the hotspots of school dropout risk. This
   phenomenon is spreading like a pandemic with spillover effects on
   neighboring delegations leading to high school dropout clusters
   probability in the northwest and south of the country. Durbin's spatial
   model reveals that a territory characterized by high illiteracy rates
   and marginal construction, business and non-public service jobs
   increases school dropout risk. Women's education level and their
   participation in economic sectors like industry, agriculture and public
   services reduces the probability of dropping out in the neighborhood.
   Accessibility to educational, cultural and sports facilities in the
   neighborhood contributes to reducing school dropout risk. Inability of
   the regional labor market to absorb university graduates favors early
   school dropout.}},

   Propensity score matching was conducted in estimating the effect of

Abstract = {{This article studies the determinants of school dropout decisions for
   western rural China by using the original and unique survey of 6,000
   families in western rural China. Special focus is given to the impact of
   religion on dropout decisions. We find that children from religious
   families are more likely to drop out of school than other children,
   especially for those practicing Tibetan Buddhism. In addition, we find
   that increase in a child's age, being a boy, and being part of an ethnic
   minority will increase the dropout probability while an increase in the
   mother's education will decrease the dropout probability. Family income
   and migration status do not have significant impact on the dropout
   decision in western rural China.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary education among lower caste adolescent girls living in rural
   Karnataka, South India, is characterized by high rates of school
   drop-out and absenteeism. A cross-sectional baseline survey (N=2275) was
   conducted in 2014 as part of a cluster-randomized control trial among
   adolescent girls (13-14 year) and their families from marginalized
   communities in two districts of north Karnataka. Bivariate and
   multivariate logistic regression models were used. Overall, 8.7\% girls
   reported secondary school dropout and 8.1\% reported frequent
   absenteeism (past month). In adjusted analyses, economic factors
   (household poverty; girls' work-related migration), social norms and
   practices (child marriage; value of girls' education), and
   school-related factors (poor learning environment and bullying/
   harassment at school) were associated with an increased odds of school
   dropout and absenteeism. Interventions aiming to increase secondary
   school retention among marginalized girls may require a multi-level
   approach, with synergistic components that address social, structural
   and economic determinants of school absenteeism and dropout. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Dropping out of high school has adverse consequences, including negative
   effects on employment, lifetime earnings, and physical health. Students
   often fail to complete high school for complex reasons that often
   manifest long before they reach high school. This study examines the
   link between participation in a comprehensive elementary school student
   support intervention and high school dropout. In this study, students
   who attended intervention elementary schools in a large, urban,
   high-poverty district during 2001-2014 (N=894) were compared to students
   who did not attend intervention schools (N=10,200). Likelihood of
   dropping out in grades 9-12 was estimated using propensity
   score-weighted Discrete Event History Analysis. Intervention students
   had approximately half the odds of dropout (p<.001); the probability of
   dropout for intervention was 9.2\%, compared to 16.6\% for
   non-intervention students. Individually tailored student support
   interventions during elementary school can lead to lasting and
   meaningful effects.}},

Title = {{Caste/ethnic differences in school dropout among 5-20-year olds in Nepal}},
Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Reducing school dropout rates has been a challenging policy problem in
   an effort to improve educational participation and attainment in
   developing countries. This paper examines the differences in school
   dropout rates among the 5-20-year olds across three major caste/ethnic
   groups in Nepal using nationally representative survey data. Findings
   suggest sizeable differences witnessed by the indigenous and especially
   lower-caste Dalit groups when compared to the historically privileged
   Hindu groups. The use of Fairlie's non-linear regression-based
   decomposition technique helps ascertain the major sources of these
   differences. Parental occupations, age, marital status and mountains,
   hills and far-western regions of residence are found to help explain
   such differences. The paper underscores the role of public policies on
   affirmative action and area-based, conditional cash transfer initiatives
   as well as effective public awareness campaigns to improve the
   educational participation of these otherwise historically disadvantaged
   caste/ethnic groups in Nepal.}},

Abstract = {{This empirical note seeks to provide preliminary insights into factors
   that may have influenced the high school dropout rate in the US cities.
   For some 300-plus cities for the year 2011, OLS estimates reveal that
   the dropout rate is a decreasing function of both the per cent of the
   population that is Hispanic and per pupil public education spending at
   the elementary and secondary levels. In addition, the estimates find
   that the dropout rate is an increasing function of the per cent of the
   population that consisted of families with children and that was
   classified as being at or below the poverty level and the per cent of
   the population aged 25years and older that did not have a high school
   diploma.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies on school dropout in Cambodia often used data from
   subjects after they already dropped out or statistics from
   education-related institutions. Using data from children in two rural
   provinces before they dropped out, this study examines four main factors
   in order to identify their influence on primary school dropout in
   Cambodia. Results from logistic regression analysis revealed that some
   predictors on individual, family, and school factors were found to be
   statistically significant to predict the odds of dropout in both grades
   1 and 5, whereas poverty and child labor could not be detected, though
   they have been frequently cited as major predictors in the literature of
   school dropout in Cambodia as well as developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{With this work we want to draw attention to a social problem that
   manifests itself with an increasingly strong intensity from year to year
   in Romania, namely school dropout problem, mainly due to deepening
   poverty (especially in rural areas but not only). In the elaboration of
   this work we started from processing and interpretation of statistical
   data provided by the National Institute of Statistics and the General
   Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection. Analysis of these
   data revealed that school dropout occurs from secondary education to the
   post high school and university levels. Develop programs, policies and
   actions to combat social problems is a goal of social assistance system
   with implications at the micro and macroeconomic level. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{This study examined a sample of primary and secondary school students
   with alternate school outcomes of high school graduation and school
   dropout Using secondary administrative data from a state department of
   education and a state department of juvenile justice, two models are
   examined in the current study. Utilizing hierarchical mixed-effects
   logistic regression models, the relative impacts of demographic
   characteristics (race, gender, birth year), school-related factors
   (grade failure, free lunch status, average number of days missed per
   year, expulsions) and juvenile justice involvement were examined on
   graduation and dropout outcomes. Across models, juvenile justice contact
   and school expulsion were the best predictors of negative school
   outcomes; The findings also demonstrate that race was not as predictive
   of dropout as were other factors. Findings suggest that interventions,
   practices, and policies in schools that may prevent negative behavior
   and subsequent consequences (expulsion and/or juvenile justice contact)
   may impact the more distal outcomes of high school graduation and
   dropout. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   School Dropout? Evidence from Aggregated Community Effects in Rural

Journal = {{EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Neighbourhoods and families are key social institutions instilled with
   development of early life course of adolescents. Limited research in
   India has examined exposure to community along with socioeconomic
   conditions for school-dropouts of girls. Multidimensional benefits of
   female education are increasingly recognized in recent years; hence, it
   becomes imperative to study the community components of school
   discontinuation particularly in rural area. This study aims to analyse
   effect of mother's education, community poverty, and gender equitable
   attitudes associated with a girl's school dropout. `this study uses
   baseline survey data from an intervention program from poor-performing
   districts of India. Collinearity among individual predictors validated
   by variance inflation factor proceeded step-wise binary-logistic
   regression. Result suggests that communities with high concentrations of
   poverty and mother illiteracy arc disadvantages with low gender
   perception and high levels of dropouts. Result suggests that girls
   living in poor communities are three times more likely to dropout and
   70\% more if belonged to communities with lower mother literacy. Girls
   who scored low on Gender Equitable Scale had less probability to
   dropout. The study concludes that girls from poor communities with low
   levels of mother literacy and non-egalitarian gender attitudes are at
   higher risk of school dropout.}},

Abstract = {{Although a substantial body of recent research has examined the impact
   of neighborhood socioeconomic distress on youth socioeconomic attainment
   and urban social dislocations, few studies have determined under what
   conditions, and for what types of adolescents, neighborhood
   characteristics matter most. Drawing on theories of collective
   socialization, social capital, and social control, we develop hypotheses
   regarding the conditional nature of neighborhood effects on the risk of
   dropping out of high school, and we then test these hypotheses by
   estimating event history models based on data from the 1968-1993 waves
   of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that, among African
   Americans, the detrimental impact of neighborhood socioeconomic distress
   on school dropout has increased significantly over the past
   quarter-century, a probable repercussion of the increasing geographic
   concentration of urban poverty. The negative effect of neighborhood
   distress on high school completion is particularly pronounced among
   black adolescents from single-parent households and among white
   adolescents from low-income families, results broadly consistent with
   Wilson's claim that exposure to neighborhood poverty reinforces the
   damaging consequences of individual disadvantage. Supporting the social
   capital perspective, among both black and white adolescents the
   deleterious impact of neighborhood distress on school dropout is
   stronger for recent in-movers than for long-term residents. The impact
   of neighborhood disadvantage also varies significantly by gender for
   both racial groups and, among whites, is stronger for younger than older
   adolescents. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these
   findings for theories of neighborhood effects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We consider extreme household poverty to be a risk factor in youth
   poverty in Mongolia, one of the 50 poorest countries in the world. The
   emphasis is placed on the identification of poverty trap mechanisms
   generated through selective access to education. We use a unique,
   nationally representative School-to-Work Transition survey. A young
   person born in a household living on US\$1 a day has a ceteris paribus
   probability of school dropout that is four times higher than a
   contemporary born into a family living on more than \$3 a day. Parental
   educational background is a good proxy of household poverty. Fairlie
   decomposition suggests that differences in characteristics expound only
   one-third of the gap. School dropout results in twice the probability of
   working poverty. It reduces the chances of women being employed and
   increases those of men, as women drop out of school to attend to
   domestic chores, while men pursue child labour in herding.}},

Abstract = {{Human behavior is dynamic, influenced by changing situations over time.
   Yet the impact of the dynamic nature of important explanatory variables
   on outcomes has only recently begun to be estimated in developmental
   models. Using a risk factor perspective, this article demonstrates the
   potential benefits of regressing time-varying outcome measures on
   time-varying explanatory measures in longitudinal models. The authors
   apply event history analysis techniques to demonstrate a methodological
   strategy that accounts for changes over time in two family risk factors
   for high school graduation. In a sample of 686 low-income youth
   attending school in an urban district, the authors found that maternal
   employment status and income are significant predictors of high school
   graduation only when conceptualized and measured as time-varying
   influences. The implications for policy and practice and, from a
   methodological perspective, for the use of time-varying explanatory
   variables in event models are discussed.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of a girls' empowerment programme on early childbearing,

   study protocol for a cluster randomized trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Adolescent pregnancies pose a risk to the young mothers and
   their babies. In Zambia, 35\% of young girls in rural areas have given
   birth by the age of 18 years. Pregnancy rates are particularly high
   among out-of-school girls. Poverty, low enrolment in secondary school,
   myths and community norms all contribute to early childbearing. This
   protocol describes a trial aiming to measure the effect on early
   childbearing rates in a rural Zambian context of (1) economic support to
   girls and their families, and (2) combining economic support with a
   community intervention to enhance knowledge about sexual and
   reproductive health and supportive community norms.
   Methods/design: This cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) will
   have three arms. The clusters are rural schools with surrounding
   communities. Approximately 4900 girls in grade 7 in 2016 will be
   recruited from 157 schools in 12 districts. In one intervention arm,
   participating girls and their guardians will be offered cash transfers
   and payment of school fees. In the second intervention arm, there will
   be both economic support and a community intervention. The interventions
   will be implemented for approximately 2 years. The final survey will be
   4.5 years after recruitment. The primary outcomes will be ``incidence of
   births within 8 months of the end of the intervention period{''},
   ``incidence of births before girls' 18th birthday{''} and ``proportion
   of girls who sit for the grade 9 exam{''}. Final survey interviewers
   will be unaware of the intervention status of respondents. Analysis will
   be by intention-to-treat and adjusted for cluster design and
   confounders. Qualitative process evaluation will be conducted.
   Discussion: This is the first CRCT to measure the effect of combining
   economic support with a community intervention to prevent adolescent
   childbearing in a low-or middle-income country. We have designed a
   programme that will be sustainable and feasible to scale up. The
   findings will be relevant for programmes for adolescent reproductive
   health in Zambia and similar contexts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an original contribution concerning the influence of
   microcredit on child school dropout rates in the poorest regions in
   Vietnam. Two crucial empirical problems for the linkage between
   microfinance and children's education are sample selection bias and the
   endogeneity of microcredit. Using a combination of the instrumental
   variable method and the Heckman approach to overcome these problems, the
   finding is that microcredit increases the opportunity for households to
   send their children to school through two main channels increasing
   household per capita income and moving households out of poverty.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we will present the results of a research that addresses a
   topical issue, which is quite frequent, especially in Romanian rural
   schools, namely the poverty and the aggressive behaviour of the pupils.
   Aggressiveness as a phenomenon seems to grow and manifests itself more
   and more often in the school environment among pupils coming from
   unstable family environments where communication and family
   relationships are in a crisis situation. This issue is carefully
   monitored and presented in the media as well. The investigation was
   conducted in a rural school in Sibiu County and represents a preliminary
   study of the need's analysis of a project that we are currently
   implementing and aims at: training teachers from disadvantaged schools
   for inclusive education, preventing and reducing of the phenomenon of
   school dropout, reducing aggressiveness, increasing student returns. We
   will present a concrete investigation into the phenomenon of violence at
   the level of a gymnasium school from a rural area. This research aims to
   look at the phenomenon of violence in school from the observational
   perspective on the one hand and from the ameliorative perspective on the
   other hand. It will try to offer (following the research results) a
   series of psycho-pedagogical assistance (in the form of individual and
   group counselling programs for students, teachers and parents). (c) 2019

Abstract = {{The authors tested a theoretical model positing that poverty has an
   indirect effect on child and adolescent functioning through children's
   poverty-related stress. Path analyses with a multiethnic sample of 164
   children aged 6 to 18 revealed that the stress associated with poverty,
   such as economic strain, family conflict, violence/trauma, and
   discrimination, is an important component of the experience of poverty
   for children. Poverty-related stress was associated with a wide range of
   correlates, including internalizing and externalizing syndromes, DSM-IV
   diagnostic symptoms, physical health, and deviant behavior such as
   pregnancy, legal problems, substance abuse, and school dropout. Most
   models fit equally well for adolescents and preadolescents, suggesting
   that poverty is stressful for children as young as 6. African American
   children's functioning was less strongly associated with poverty-related
   stress than was the functioning of Hispanic and Caucasian children.
   Implications of poverty-related stress as a potential mechanism of
   poverty's pernicious effect on child functioning are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews research suggesting that the prevention of
   intergenerational poverty will be enhanced if we add evidence-based
   family and school prevention programs to address the adverse social
   environments that often accompany poverty. Government policies such as
   the Earned Income Tax Credit can reduce family poverty, but simply
   improving the economic stability of the family will not necessarily
   prevent the development of child and adolescent problems such as
   academic failure, antisocial behavior, drug abuse, and depression, all
   of which can undermine future economic wellbeing. The authors briefly
   review the evidence linking family poverty to adverse social
   environments, which can have deleterious effects on children's
   behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and neurophysiological development.
   They then document the value of evidence-based family- and school-based
   prevention programs in effectively addressing these behavioral,
   emotional, cognitive, and neurophysiological factors that can put
   children at risk for continued poverty in adulthood. They also describe
   3 family-based prevention programs that have been found to have a direct
   effect on families' future economic wellbeing. The evidence indicates
   that widely disseminating effective and efficient family- and
   school-based prevention programs can help to address both poverty itself
   and the effects of adverse social environments, making future poverty
   less likely. The authors conclude with specific recommendations for
   federal and state policymakers, researchers, and practitioners.}},

Title = {{Understanding orphan and non-orphan adolescents' sexual risks in the
   context of poverty: a qualitative study in Nyanza Province, Kenya}},
Journal = {{BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Some studies show orphanhood to be associated with increased
   sexual risk-taking while others have not established this relationship,
   but have found factors other than orphanhood as predictors of sexual
   risk behaviours and outcomes among adolescents. This study examines
   community members' perceptions of how poverty influences adolescent
   sexual behaviour and outcomes in four districts of Nyanza Province,
   Kenya.
   Methods: Eight study sites within the four districts were randomly
   selected. Focus group discussions were conducted with a purposive sample
   of adolescents, parents and caregivers. Key informant interviews were
   undertaken with a purposive sample of community leaders, child welfare
   and healthcare workers, and adolescents. The two methods elicited
   information on factors perceived to predispose adolescent orphans and
   non-orphans to sexual risks. Data were analysed through line-by-line
   coding, grouped into families and retrieved as themes and sub-themes.
   Results: Participants included 147 adolescents and parents/caregivers in
   14 focus groups and 13 key informants. Poverty emerged as a key
   predisposing factor to sexual risk behaviour among orphans and
   non-orphans. Poverty was associated with lack of food, poor housing,
   school dropout, and engaging in income generating activities, all of
   which increase their vulnerability to transactional sex, early marriage,
   sexual experimentation, and the eventual consequences of increased risk
   of unintended pregnancies and STI/HIV.
   Conclusion: Poverty was perceived to contribute to increasing sexual
   risks among orphan and non-orphan adolescents through survival
   strategies adopted to be able to meet their basic needs. Policies for
   prevention and intervention that target adolescents in a generalized
   poverty and HIV epidemic should integrate economic empowerment for
   caregivers and life skills for adolescents to reduce vulnerabilities of
   orphan and non-orphan adolescents to sexual risk behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the connection between immigration status, English
   language proficiency, and educational achievement as determinants of
   poverty among Mexico-born migrants in Chicago, U.S. The theoretical
   framework of the study uses Human Capital Theory and the analysis is
   based on a multi-stage cluster probabilistic sample (2005-2006) of
   Mexican migrants obtained in Cook County which includes the City of
   Chicago. Analyses of contingency tables and logistic regression models
   show that the most relevant connections occur between poverty and
   immigration status as well as between poverty and English language
   proficiency. Thus, Mexican immigrants with citizenship status, work
   permits, or residency permits ({''}green cards{''}) and Mexican
   immigrants with high English language proficiency have a lower
   probability to be below the poverty threshold than their counterparts.
   The analysis of the sample's educational achievement in Mexico shows
   that these immigrants tend to have low levels of education and that the
   problems associated with school dropout among Mexican migrants extends
   below high school. Similarly, the educational achievement obtained in
   the U.S. is significantly low among the individuals in the sample. These
   results point to the plight of the large levels of undocumented workers
   with low English proficiency and suggest the existence of structural
   problems that impede significant returns to human capital investments on
   Mexican education in the U.S. labor market.}},

Abstract = {{This study, aimed at determining the reasons for dropouts of the formal
   secondary education of girls living in rural areas, employed
   phenomenological methodology from the qualitative research approaches.
   The study group includes 30 female students, who live in a town in the
   Black Sea Region of Turkey and who dropped out of formal secondary
   education, and their parents. The data were collected by interview
   technique. In the interviews, personal, social, economic and cultural
   information about the students and the families, and the reasons why the
   children did not attend school were obtained. The data were analyzed
   using thematic analysis technique. Precautions were taken to increase
   the validity and reliability of the data collection, processing and
   analysis processes. As a result, the vital causes for school dropout of
   the girls in the study group were found as insecurity, conservatism,
   poverty, and failure. The school dropout of the majority of children is
   resulted from two or more reasons coming together. Insecurity /
   conservatism, insecurity / poverty and insecurity / conservatism /
   poverty are the leading reasons for the girls leaving the school in the
   study group. The combination of reasons for dropout differs from student
   to student. It is suggested that, within this context, preventive
   measures for student dropouts should be diversified by the goverment on
   a student basis.}},

Abstract = {{Educational success is often synonymous with attainment of academic
   qualifications. However for some students, simply continuing to attend
   school rather than dropping out may represent an important attainment,
   and completion of secondary school significantly reduces chances of
   subsequent chronic poverty. The longitudinal US NELS dataset was
   assessed to examine predictors of dropout. Results supported a
   differentiated perspective of student outcomes whereby dropout before
   Grade 12 was predicted far less by prior academic achievement in Grade 8
   than academic achievement in Grade 12, and to a greater extent by
   non-cognitive measures such as daily school preparation, planning and
   subjective peer perception. Cognitive ability measures are known to
   correlate well with academic achievement but ``non-cognitive
   abilities{''} may have an important role in the prediction of
   persistence, especially among marginalised students.}},

Abstract = {{This prospective study of 276 Virginia public high schools found that
   the prevalence of teasing and bullying (PTB) as perceived by both
   9th-grade students and teachers was predictive of dropout rates for this
   cohort 4 years later. Negative binomial regression indicated that one
   standard deviation increases in student- and teacher-reported PTB were
   associated with 16.5\% and 10.8\% increases in the number of dropouts,
   respectively, after controlling for the effects of other predictors,
   including school size, student body poverty and minority composition,
   community crime rates, and performance on standardized achievement
   testing. The predictive values of student and teacher perceptions of PTB
   were comparable in magnitude to the predictive values for other commonly
   recognized correlates of dropout rates. These results provide new
   evidence that the prevalence of peer victimization in high school is an
   important factor in high school academic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Development sectors like health cannot function in isolation.
   Intersectoral coordination between various departments helps in bringing
   a positive change in the health-seeking behavior of society in the long
   run. The decision by the Government of India to provide free solar
   lanterns (lamps) to the school-going girls of below poverty line
   families is a welcome step in this context. This initiative would help
   in reducing the number of school dropout girls and thus help in
   improving the health indicators that are directly related to women's
   education. Thus it is an initiative that will help in attainment of
   Millennium Development Goals through women's education and empowerment.
   Along with that, the environment-friendly approach will definitely have
   an impact on health of the girls by switching from kerosene/wood stoves
   to solar lantern light. Also this initiative would pave the path of real
   ``intersectoral coordination{''} in the health sector in India that is
   marred with watertight functioning of various departments. There is an
   urgent need to popularize the scheme and involve different stakeholders
   like corporate houses, media, nongovernment organizations, multinational
   welfare agencies, and local governing bodies for ensuring the
   availability and utilization of solar lanterns in India.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE}},

Pages = {{98-112}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses how perceptions of personal security can impact on
   school enrolment and attendance. It mainly focuses on threats of
   physical harm, crime, and community and domestic violence. These
   security fears can include insecurity that children suffer from as they
   go to school, maybe through the use of unsafe routes; insecurity that
   children feel at school; and the insecurity they suffer from in their
   homes. Although poverty can be a source and/or an indicator of
   insecurity, this paper does not focus solely on poverty as it is well
   covered elsewhere in the literature. The paper relies on qualitative
   data collected in Korogocho and Viwandani slum areas in Nairobi, Kenya
   between October and November 2004. The paper analyses data from
   individual interviews and focus group interviews and focuses on the
   narrative of slum dwellers on how insecurity impacts on educational
   attainment. The conclusion in this paper is that insecure neighbourhoods
   may have a negative impact on schooling. As a result policies that
   address insecurity in slum neighbourhoods can also improve school
   attendance and performance.}},

Abstract = {{School belonging is a topic of growing interest given its connection
   with school dropout, academic achievement, students' behavior, and
   adolescent well-being. Until recently, most of this literature came from
   Anglo-Saxon contexts, mainstream schools, and quantitative analysis. As
   a result, there is still a research gap on this issue in different
   cultural contexts, social classes, and minority groups. This article
   makes a contribution exploring school belonging among adolescents from
   disadvantaged backgrounds, in an emerging economy (Mexico), and using a
   qualitative methodology that prioritize meanings and experiences of
   individuals. Focusing on three dimensions (stigmatization processes,
   school climate, and social relations with teacher and peers), we capture
   how the engagement of adolescents with their schooling process is shaped
   by institutional as well as sociocultural aspects. The study provides
   significant implications for a continuous professional development of
   high schools in disadvantaged contexts regarding student involvement,
   teacher support, and social recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Education is important for the successful development and growth of
   individuals and societies, yet some factors adversely affect its
   provision. This article reports on a study that explored the factors
   that adversely affect education in the Builsa District located in the
   Upper East Region (UER) of Northern Ghana, by examining the attitudes
   and concerns of the people in Chuchuliga regarding education. Surveys
   were administered to students, parents/guardians and head teachers, and
   interviews and focus group discussions were held with opinion leaders
   and school dropouts, respectively. A striking finding was that the Tono
   Irrigation Dam located at Navrongo and farming, which is the predominant
   economic activity, negatively affect education in the community. Further
   findings were that the late introduction of education in Northern Ghana
   and traditional beliefs about education, as well as other
   long-established factors are responsible for high illiteracy and
   school-dropout rates. Recommendations to improve the quality of
   education in the district and country are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to examine whether use of tobacco, alcohol,
   and illicit drugs predicts dropout among secondary school students in
   Cape Town, South Africa. A self-report instrument was administered to
   1,470 Grade 8 students. The proportion of students that dropped out of
   school between the onset of the study and 4 years later was 54.9\%.
   After adjusting for a range of confounders, dropout was significantly
   predicted by absenteeism, poverty (as assessed by a possession index),
   and past month cigarette use, but not by past month alcohol use and
   lifetime illicit drug use. Contrary to findings from developed
   countries, alcohol and illicit drug use did not predict dropout. It is
   possible that predictors of dropout documented elsewhere may not be
   pertinent in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{This article offers a phenomenological examination of the future
   orientation of 24 Muslim male high school dropout youth in Israel. This
   research is important in light of the multiple social exclusions, or
   structural vulnerabilities, these youths experience on the basis of
   poverty, stigmatized religious-national identity, and dropping out of
   school. The study's findings reveal three prominent future orientations:
   a refusal to engage in the future and a preference for examining the
   present; a closed future (expressed as a strong belief that the distant
   future will likely resemble the present); and a primary aspiration to
   become solo self-employed (i.e., occupationally independent), along with
   a unique rationale for explaining this aspiration. The Discussion
   expands on the impact of the youths' structural vulnerability on their
   future orientation, the symbolism of their aspiration to be
   self-employed in the future, and the linkages between culture, future
   orientation, and inequality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the residential segregation effects on educational
   attainment of children from regional migrant families in China. We find
   that if migrant families live in segregated communities with fewer local
   residents, the school dropout rate of the children living with their
   parents in the host cities is higher and their high school enrollment
   rate is lower. We employ a unique set of nationwide survey data of
   regional migrants in China in 2012 and 2013 that comprises more than
   150,000 individuals in each year. We first use the ratio of migrants
   over the total population residing in a community to measure
   segregation. When the ratio increases by 10\%, the school dropout rate
   of migrant children increases by 4.7\% from the mean value. Secondly, we
   identify segregation from the housing type of the migrant family. When
   they reside in the dorms provided by their employers or in the
   workplace, they will also be surrounded by many migrant colleagues. We
   find that living in such places increases the ``not-going-to-high-school
   rate{''} of migrant children by 35\% from the mean value. Our subsample
   analysis indicates that the segregation effects only exist in the
   samples of male migrant children and rural hukou families.}},

Title = {{Academic Differences Between an Urban Nativity School and an Urban
   Public School District}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS}},
Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that both poverty and minority status
   significantly influence academic achievement. Nativity schools, which
   have been extensively researched, have been found effective for students
   coming from low socioeconomic statuses and diverse backgrounds.
   Differences were examined between an urban public school district and an
   urban parochial school that uses the Nativity model (henceforth referred
   to as Nativity School). The purpose of this study was to determine if
   students from Nativity School were able to achieve significantly above
   that which urban public school students achieved. Specifically, academic
   achievement in the areas of mathematics, language arts, and science were
   analyzed, as well as high school dropout rate, high school graduation
   rate, and entrance into postsecondary education. Nativity School used
   the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) to measure achievement
   longitudinally and reported stanines and local and national percentile
   ranks, while the public school system used the Missouri Assessment
   Program (MAP) and provided four descriptor categories (i.e., Below
   Basic, Basic, Proficient, and Advanced). Below Basic and Basic referred
   to students who demonstrate the skills outlined by the Missouri Show-Me
   Standards inconsistently and/or incorrectly, while students who perform
   in the Proficient and Advanced categories demonstrate these skills
   consistently, at or above grade level. Results revealed Nativity School
   students significantly improved their academic achievement scores and
   were more likely than urban public school students to graduate high
   school and enroll in postsecondary school. Interpretation and
   implications of these results and limitations are explored.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider why students in poor and rural regions of
   China are dropping out of school in numbers that may be greater than
   official statistics admit. With questions about education quality among
   the most intractable in Education for All initiatives across the
   developing world, we sketch a portrait of education in a remote mountain
   village community as it might be painted from the perspective of a
   primary school dropout: a portrait in which education quality is well in
   the shadows. We indicate the limits of the view that commonly relates
   the phenomenon of school dropout primarily with poverty, a lack of
   school resources and inequities in resource distribution, suggesting
   that the picture is more nuanced and subtly shaded at local levels. Our
   research indicates that the education system in the radically
   transitional society that China is today brings with it values that
   clash with those of its citizens, particularly those who are
   marginalized and cannot easily adjust, perhaps because of their
   disadvantaged socio-economic, cultural and geographic location. In an
   ethnographic study in a poor, rural area in Yunnan province, we found
   significant disjunctions in values: between those of the school system
   and those of parents with regard to the aims and purposes of education;
   between those of the curriculum and those of teachers with regard to
   their role in the classroom vis-a-vis knowledge as represented in
   textbooks; between those of government education policy and the concerns
   of the remote rural poor with regard to resource distribution; and
   between those of a newly market-oriented society and educational ideals
   about teachers' and students' abilities. We also offer some insight into
   the scale and complexity of the problems associated with a lack of
   education quality and students' dropping out of school as a consequence,
   which cannot be revealed by the official 1\% dropout rate. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The introduction of universal primary education in sub-Sahara African
   countries in the 1990s increased enrolment rates and provided
   opportunities to children who were previously not in school. Research
   demonstrates that eliminating fees is not the magic bullet that delivers
   universal access. This study seeks to determine risk factors associated
   with dropout among primary school children in the low-income areas of
   Nairobi. Qualitative data is from the Education Research Program,
   collected between June and July 2008. The study found that: dumpsites in
   the two slum sites of Korogocho and Viwandani lure children out of
   school; school levies still charged in schools keep children out of
   school; and chronic poverty within families lure girls aged 14-16 into
   transactional sex. In conclusion, the declaration of free primary
   education is not sufficient to realize improved educational attainment
   as dropout after initial entry negates the purpose for which it was
   introduced.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses data from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to examine the
   factors associated with schoolgirl pregnancy and subsequent educational
   pathways. We find that prior schooling discontinuities-defined as
   instances of non-pregnancy-related grade repetition or temporary
   withdrawals from school-are strongly associated with a young woman's
   likelihood of later becoming pregnant while enrolled in school, dropping
   out of school if she becomes pregnant, and not returning to school
   following a pregnancy-related dropout. Young women who are the primary
   caregivers to their children are also significantly more likely to leave
   school than are those who have help with their childcare
   responsibilities. Given the increasing importance of female school
   participation in sub-Saharan Africa, programs must be designed to reach
   girls and their families early to increase incentives for ensuring their
   timely progression through school and to increase their access to
   reproductive health information and services.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents who drop out of high school experience enduring negative
   consequences across many domains. Yet, the circumstances triggering
   their departure are poorly understood. This study examined the
   precipitating role of recent psychosocial stressors by comparing three
   groups of Canadian high school students (52\% boys; M-age=16.3years;
   N=545): recent dropouts, matched at-risk students who remain in school,
   and average students. Results indicate that in comparison with the two
   other groups, dropouts were over three times more likely to have
   experienced recent acute stressors rated as severe by independent
   coders. These stressors occurred across a variety of domains.
   Considering the circumstances in which youth decide to drop out has
   implications for future research and for policy and practice.}},

Title = {{Acceptability of an economic support component to reduce early pregnancy
   and school dropout in Zambia: a qualitative case study}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cash Transfer (CT) schemes have become popular poverty
   reducing measures in many low and middle-income countries. Research
   indicates that when provided to girls in resource poor settings, cash
   transfers can increase education and postpone marriage and pregnancy.
   However, a few studies indicate that they can also have negative effects
   which can affect their acceptability, such as generating intra-community
   tensions. Objective: Conceptually informed by Rogers' diffusion of
   innovation theory, this paper explores factors affecting the
   acceptability of economic support in a randomized controlled trial in
   rural Monze and Pemba Districts of Southern Province in Zambia. Methods:
   Qualitative data were collected through five focus group discussions and
   six in-depth, semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic
   analysis. This study was done in the combined arm of a trial where girls
   received both economic support and participated in youth clubs offering
   sexuality and life-skills education. Results: In the study communities,
   acceptability was encouraging by the belief that economic support
   provided benefits beyond beneficiaries and that it improved access to
   education, and reduced teen pregnancies, marriages and school drop-out.
   However, provision of economic support only to selected girls and their
   parents and fear among some that the support was linked to satanic
   practices negatively affected acceptability. These fears were mitigated
   through community sensitisations. Conclusion: The study demonstrated
   that relative advantage, observability, simplicity and compatibility
   were key factors in influencing acceptability of the economic support.
   However, to enhance acceptability of cash transfer schemes aimed at
   addressing early marriage and pregnancy, it is important to explore
   socio-cultural factors that create suspicions and negative perceptions
   and to provide schemes that are perceived as relatively better than
   available similar schemes, understood, compatible and viable beyond the
   immediate beneficiary.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the number of early school leavers, those who quit education
   without at least a high school degree, is a key objective of educational
   policy throughout Europe. Previous research has shown that in particular
   youngsters from disadvantaged families face relatively high risks of
   school dropout. In this paper we use data from the 2009 ad hoc module of
   the Labour Force Survey to examine how macro-level determinants
   influence school dropout risks among different social groups. Our
   results indicate that both the design of the educational system
   (tracking age, extent of vocational education) and characteristics of
   the socioeconomic context (poverty rate, unemployment patterns) have an
   impact on the social distribution of school dropout risk.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that the roots of school dropout (a) can be
   established early in life, (b) are likely to involve multilevel factors
   (home, child, classroom) operating prior to and during the elementary
   school years, and (c) can be identified by 3rd grade. The decision to
   drop out of school is thus a dynamic developmental process that can
   begin with disengagement in elementary school. Yet few studies have
   examined the multilevel factors that might contribute to children's
   early disengagement from school. In the present study, we examined
   associations between household chaos (i.e., disorganization and
   instability) from birth to age 5 and student (dis)engagement in third
   grade. We also examined positive parenting in early childhood (6-60
   months) and child self-regulatory skills at kindergarten as potential
   mediators in this pathway. Participants were 1,097 children who
   participated in the Family Life Project, a longitudinal study of the
   development of children living in underresourced high poverty rural
   areas. Study questions were addressed using structural equation models.
   Results indicated that, even after taking into account a considerable
   number of covariates, early positive parenting and children's
   self-regulatory skills were viable process mechanisms through which
   early household disorganization, but not instability, was linked to
   student (dis) engagement in third grade. Findings are discussed with
   respect to the multilevel proximal forces at play in children's risk for
   early disengagement from school.}},

Abstract = {{Minority children living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at high risk
   for school dropout, delinquency, and poor health, largely due to the
   negative impact of poverty and stress on parenting and child
   development. This study evaluated a population-level, family-centered,
   school-based intervention designed to promote learning, behavior, and
   health by strengthening parenting, classroom quality, and child
   self-regulation during early childhood. Ten schools in urban districts
   serving primarily low-income Black students were randomly assigned to
   intervention or a ``pre-kindergarten education as usual{''} control
   condition. Intervention included a family program (a 13-week behavioral
   parenting intervention and concurrent group for children) and
   professional development for early childhood teachers. The majority (88
   \%) of the pre-kindergarten population (N = 1,050; age 4) enrolled in
   the trial, and nearly 60 \% of parents in intervention schools
   participated in the family program. This study evaluated intervention
   impact on parenting (knowledge, positive behavior support, behavior
   management, involvement in early learning) and child conduct problems
   over a 2-year period (end of kindergarten). Intent-to-treat analyses
   found intervention effects on parenting knowledge, positive behavior
   support, and teacher-rated parent involvement. For the highest-risk
   families, intervention also resulted in increased parent-rated
   involvement in early learning and decreased harsh and inconsistent
   behavior management. Among boys at high risk for problems based on
   baseline behavioral dysregulation (age 4, 23 \% of sample), intervention
   led to lower rates of conduct problems at age 6. Family-centered
   intervention at the transition to school has potential to improve
   population health and break the cycle of disadvantage for low-income,

Abstract = {{The indigenous people have been identified to be among the poorest and
   the most socioeconomically and culturally marginalized people all over
   the world. The main purpose of the paper is to explore the socioeconomic
   and demographic factors of indigenous people in Peninsular Malaysia in
   context of poverty and the role of income dependency of non-timber
   forest products (NTFP). The data were collected in 2014 and 2015 through
   primary and secondary sources. Partial least squares (PLS) method was
   used to analysis the data. PLS is a modeling technique that features
   multiple regression and principal component analysis. The study shows
   that still a large number of indigenous households is involved in the
   NTFP activities. But the communities are moving away from NTFP based
   income to cash-crop based income because of poor sustainable forest
   management and lack of forest property rights. However, NTFP have a
   significant role in the household income and contribute 24\% of the
   average income. Moreover, the analysis shows that location is
   significant to the poverty. There should be a suitable sustainable
   forest management system which can teach these indigenous communities
   about proper way of NTFP gathering and given proper rights to forest
   land. Furthermore, education is not significant to indigenous people and
   there is a high rate of school dropout among them. The government should
   introduce a different education system for indigenous communities which
   will emphasize the importance of education to them.}},

Abstract = {{Dropout school/university is a phenomenon with major implications for
   formal education. A number of factors such as poverty, family breakdown,
   quality of life, subculture groups, ethnic traditions, etc. are causes
   of dropout, claiming these remedial solutions. Support programs have not
   been effective since they contributed only little to reduce school
   dropout.
   The study we propose reveals a set of causes and proposes new
   strategies, applying their lead to equalization of opportunities for
   access to school education / university.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the Youth Development Program (YDP), a component of
   the federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA). We examine whether the YDP
   reduced dropout rates among youth in secondary schools in seven school
   districts in the impoverished Mississippi River Delta in southeast
   Arkansas. Initially, the program seems to have an impact. Students who
   participate in the program are less likely to drop out of school than
   students in a comparison group. However, when other factors are taken
   into consideration, such as whether the student was over-age for their
   grade (and thus likely had been held back), the effect that program
   participation had on the likelihood of dropping out disappears. In
   short, we find that when controlling for other factors, no statistically
   significant relationship exists between program participation and
   dropout rates. We discuss the implications of the WIA's YDP failure and
   school retention programs, more broadly.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to assess the causes, experience and Mitigating
   mechanism of school dropout among primary school students in Benchi-Maji
   zone Shey Bench Wereda. The study mainly attempted to answer research
   questions like the major reason that leads students' to drop out, the
   experiences of dropouts while they were out of school and mitigating
   mechanism of school dropout. The study adopted a qualitative research
   approach, and non-probability sampling techniques were used to identify
   participants of the study. An in-depth interview and focus group
   discussions are utilized as the main tools of data collection.
   Interviews were conducted with key informants like homeroom teachers,
   principal's parents, and students. Thirty-three (33) participants were
   involved in an interview, and three focus group discussion is comprising
   10 participants in each group were conducted accordingly. Generally,
   data were collected from 63 purposively sampled participants. The
   researcher transcribed the notes taken while having an interview and FGD
   with children's (students), teachers and parents. The transcription,
   which is written in the Amharic language was translated to English as
   accurately as possible and presented in a narrative way through thematic
   analysis. Poverty, the absence of motivation and interest, peer pressure
   and school-related difficulties were identified as the main cause of
   school dropout. With regard to the experience of dropouts, the majority
   of dropouts engaged in helping families, leave the area in search of
   jobs and create different work opportunities to deal with life. In
   addition working with financial aid organizations, GOs, NGOs,
   eliminating illiteracy of the society through awareness creation
   programs, developing a good interpersonal relationship with students, a
   participating community in educational programs are among major
   mechanisms identified by stakeholders as a mitigating mechanism of
   school dropout. Finally based on the findings, conclusions and
   recommendations were made.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the extent to which state-mandated high school
   exit examinations are associated with state-level public high school
   completion rates in the United States. The authors estimate a series of

   public high school completion rates and archival information about
   states' policies on high school exit examinations from 1975 through
   2002. The study finds that state high school exit
   examinations-particularly the ``more difficult{''} examinations that
   have been implemented recently in some states-are associated with lower
   public high school completion rates and higher rates of General
   Educational Development test taking. Furthermore, the study finds that
   the association between state policies on high school exit examinations
   and public high school completion grows stronger as states become more
   racially and ethnically diverse and as poverty rates increase.}},

Abstract = {{The school dropout is a not negligible phenomenon that, if not
   effectively contrasted, puts at risk the future of young people and
   expose them to greater risks of unemployement, poverty and social
   exclusion compared to peers with a good instruction level. In this paper
   we present AYO!, an extracurricolar laboratory aimed to contrast the
   high school dropout. AYO! is an acronym that means Assemble Your
   Objects, and it was choosen, in addition to literal meaning, for the
   assonance with the dialectal Sardinian's expression Ajo!, which is an
   exhortation that can be translated into english in ``come on!{''} or
   ``get a move on!{''}. AYO! allows engagement of students in design,
   realization and use of sensors and actuators systems with the aim of
   monitoring and analyzing the ambient around them.
   The practical activities have allowed to provide knowledge about very
   interesting topics for labour market and to develop awareness of how
   technological innovation can be used to understand the phenomena that
   surround them (eg. pollution, energy consumption, etc.). Specifically,
   the laboratory focuses on the paradigm of the Internet of Things which
   constitutes a key topic from the point of view of today scientific
   research and business strategies.}},

Abstract = {{One of the Millennium Development Goals for 2015 was to achieve
   universal access to primary education for everyone, but there are still
   58 million children between 6 and 11 years old out of school, a
   situation that affects mainly girls. The lowest rates of primary school
   enrolment are at subsaharan Africa, Where only 65\% of children attend
   school (UNESCO, 2014). To this situation, we have to add that one of
   every three girls leave education and doesn't access to secondary school
   (Plan, 2012). Given this background, this research aims to explore the
   factors that contribute to the dropout of girls in primary education
   levels in central Kibosho (Tanzania). It has carried out a qualitative
   exploratory study which includes semi-structured interviews with 20
   participants and focus groups with 12 teachers. The results show that
   the dropout of girls has various socioeconomic and gender factors such
   as poverty, lack of moral support, illiteracy of the parents, initiation
   rituals, early pregnancy, household chores, lack of resources and
   motivation of teachers in rural schools. Following the results, the
   paper presents a series of recommendations to both the government of
   Tanzania and the various educational agents to prevent dropout of girls
   and young women.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate the threshold-like effects of four
   aspects of neighborhood environment: poverty rate, adult nonemployment
   rate, female headship rate for families with children, and secondary
   school dropout rate. We used a sample consisting of virtually all,
   census tracts from U.S. metropolitan areas. The relationship between the
   value of numerous neighborhood indicators in 1980 and subsequent changes
   in each of the four dimensions of neighborhood quality of family life
   from 1980 to 1990 was evaluated statistically using a regression model
   with a spline specification to test for nonlinear, threshold-like
   processes.
   Stressing the exploratory nature of the study, we find evidence of
   threshold-like effects in an endodynamic relationship (poverty rate and
   subsequent changes in that rate), and in exodynamic relationships
   (occupational status and rental rates and subsequent changes in several
   neighborhood quality indicators). Implications for research and a
   spatially targeted neighborhood reinvestment policy are derived from the
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This study merged two theoretical constructs: cumulative risk and
   allostatic load. Physical (crowding, noise, housing quality) and
   psychosocial (child separation, turmoil, violence) aspects of the home
   environment and personal characteristics (poverty, single parenthood,
   maternal high school dropout status) were modeled in a cumulative risk
   heuristic. Elevated cumulative risk was associated with heightened
   cardiovascular and neuroendocrine parameters, increased deposition of
   body fat, and a higher summary index of total allostatic load. Previous
   findings that children who face more cumulative risk have greater
   psychological distress were replicated among a sample of rural children
   and shown to generalize to lower perceptions of self-worth. Prior
   cumulative risk research was further extended through demonstration of
   self-regulatory behavior problems and elevated learned helplessness.}},

Abstract = {{Economic disadvantage is a strong predictor of social exclusion,
   disengagement at school, early school dropout and low educational
   attainment. This paper shows that experience of significant events for
   example, moving home and school following parents' separation; a sudden
   fall in family income; or illness and death in the family can greatly
   exacerbate economically disadvantaged young people's sense of exclusion
   and disengagement. Survey data are used to show that such negative
   events (often characterised by young people as `shocks') are most likely
   to occur among economically disadvantaged families with children.
   In-depth interviews with young people are also used to explore young
   people's construction of these events, which they often describe in
   terms of a cascade, with several shocks following each other in rapid
   succession, draining away their, and their families', economic, social
   and emotional resources, and leaving them at risk of further exclusion.
   The paper concludes that policy needs to buffer young people better from
   the effects of these events, and so reduce their disengagement and
   exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{More than 300 rural counties are more prosperous than the nation. Each
   has lower unemployment rates, lower poverty rates, lower school dropout
   rates, and better housing conditions than the nation. Prosperous
   counties tend to have more educated populations, more diverse economies,
   more private non-farm jobs, more farmers and government farm payments,
   more creative class occupations, and more equal income distributions.
   They have fewer African-American, American Indian, or Hispanic residents
   and fewer recent immigrants. Some findings support what many rural
   people believe to be true: civically engaged religious groups and other
   identities that bind people together can really matter. Other results
   contradict conventional wisdom. For instance, climate and distances to
   cities and major airports, are relatively unimportant. Focusing on
   prosperity, instead of growth or competitiveness, provides new insights
   into rural conditions and prospects.}},

   adolescent girls' school withdrawal during pregnancy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{87}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An early pregnancy often puts an end to a girls' education. However, few
   studies have investigated which factors affect adolescents' school
   discontinuation during pregnancy. This study interviewed 1,046
   adolescent mothers from the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. The
   results showed that a quarter of school-going adolescent girls withdrew
   from school during the pregnancy - many as early as the first trimester.
   School withdrawal was associated with higher poverty, higher grade
   repetition, an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, and greater lack of
   information about the pregnancy. Given the high enrolment rates at the
   onset of the pregnancy, school-based services may provide an opportunity
   to identify which girls require substantial support to remain in
   education throughout pregnancy, using a history of poor school
   performance as an indicator for dropout.}},

Abstract = {{The child labour is a generic phenomenon and it is far the spinoff of
   socio-monetary shape and reflection of the society. The child labour can
   be labeled into dangerous and non-risky labour. Many mother and father
   purposely dispatched their youngsters to workplaces with purpose to
   enhance own family profits and to conquer poverty by hook or by crook
   causing dropping out in their children from faculties despite the
   government efforts. Non-education of children has in detail connected
   with exploitation of child labour that is the effect of collective
   discrimination, thoughts of the privileged group \& meager participation
   within the safety of legitimate right, lack of parental motivation and
   high rate of education also make a contribution to hassle of the
   troubles of child labour. Bannu is one of the fastest-growing cities in
   Pakistan, especially in training, industries, and hotels. The objectives
   of this study are to explore different reasons for child labour and to
   find out the impact of child labour on the dropout of children from the
   schools. (C) 2019 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.}},

Abstract = {{Maltreated youth have higher rates of school dropout than their
   non-maltreated peers. School connectedness is a modifiable predictor of
   school success. We hypothesized maltreated youth's school connectedness
   (supportive relationships with adults at school and participation in
   school clubs) would be positively associated with high school
   graduation. We included youth with at least one Child Protective
   Services (CPS) report by age twelve from Longitudinal Studies of Child
   Abuse and Neglect, a prospective cohort study. Participation in
   extracurricular activities and adult relationships reported at age 16,
   high school graduation/General Education Development (GED) status
   reported at age 18, and demographics were provided by youth and
   caregivers. Maltreatment data were coded from CPS records. The outcome
   was graduation/receipt of GED. Multivariable logistic regressions
   examined the association between school connectedness and
   graduation/receipt of GED, controlling for confounders. In our sample of
   318 maltreated youth, 73.3\% graduated. School club was the only
   activity with a statistically significant association with graduation in
   bivariate analysis. Having supportive relationships with an adult at
   school was not significantly associated with graduation, though only
   10.7\% of youth reported this relationship. Maltreated youth who
   participated in school clubs had 2.54 times the odds of graduating,
   adjusted for study site, gender; poverty status, caregiver high school
   graduation status, and age at first CPS report (95\% CI: {[}1.02,
   6.33]). Few maltreated youth reported relationships with adults at
   school, and additional efforts may be needed to support these vulnerable
   youth. School club participation may represent an opportunity to modify
   maltreated youth's risk for school dropout.}},

Abstract = {{The status quo of Roma communities in Europe is strongly marked by
   marginalisation and discrimination. Roma people tend to face social
   exclusion and segregation leading to lack of education, chronic
   unemployment and limited access to healthcare, housing and public
   services as well as widespread poverty. Very few studies have been
   conducted as far as Roma community in Cyprus are concerned and almost
   none has explored quality of life of this ethnic minority. Therefore,
   this article examines quality of life dimensions in approximately half
   of the population (n=156) residing in the catchment area. Both
   quantitative and qualitative results showed poor standards of living,
   high school dropout rates and high levels of marginalisation. Social
   work as discipline can foster a more empowering and coordinating role as
   to enhance Roma's distinctive identity and improve standards of living.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this article was to identify effective
   interventions to reduce secondary school dropout rates, increase the
   quality of learning in secondary schools in developing countries, and
   estimate the cost and educational impact of a sustained program to
   implement a selection of these interventions.
   Methods: Dropout risk is analyzed by multivariable regression using
   micro-datasets for 44 developing countries for which Demographic and
   Health Surveys are available. The analysis of interventions accesses
   recent meta-analyses of educational interventions in developing
   countries. We incorporate these results into a model of progression in
   secondary schooldbygrade, age, and gender, augmented by learning
   measures and by a facility to allowinterventions to reduce dropout rates
   and improve learning-to estimate the impact and cost of a package of
   interventions out to 2030.
   Results: Poverty, female gender, and rural location are key risk factors
   for secondary school dropout. In terms of interventions, school
   proximity for rural students is critical. Better teaching both reduces
   dropout and improves learning, whereas instruction in the mother tongue
   improves also improves learning. Systematic implementation of nine
   interventions in the 44 countries, 1 costing US\$10.5 per capita per
   annum, would increase secondary completion rates by about 25\% and more
   than double the index of learning achieved by 2030, with the effects
   being more pronounced in low-income countries.
   Conclusions: Powerful interventions are available to change the
   trajectory of schooling in developing countries but the costs are
   substantial, and a coordinated funding effort will be required. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority youth group in the
   United States. Currently, Latino adolescents experience higher rates of
   teen pregnancy compared to any other racial or ethnic group and have
   disproportionately high levels of sexually transmitted infections and
   HIV. Latino teens are also affected by a number of social problems such
   as school dropout, poverty, depression and limited access to healthcare,
   which contributes to disparities in reproductive health outcomes for
   this population. Relatively few intervention research studies and
   programs have been dedicated to reducing sexual risk among Latino youth,
   despite their particular vulnerabilities in experiencing negative
   reproductive health outcomes. We provide recommendations for identifying
   the unique reproductive health needs of Latino youth and specific
   applied strategies so that agency-based social workers and other
   providers can develop family-based interventions that improve adolescent
   Latino sexual and reproductive health.}},

Abstract = {{Previous contextual analyses of recidivism are limited by a focus on
   traditional disadvantage indicators. The authors examine whether those
   indicators, including poverty, family composition, high school dropout,
   and unemployment explain disproportionate involvement in serious
   criminal recidivism among African American relative to White
   ex-prisoners. Given the fundamental necessity of finding employment
   after release, the authors move beyond traditional measures and
   investigate the availability of low-skill employment opportunity in the
   industries that prior research suggests are most likely to hire
   ex-prisoners (retail and manufacturing). To address the issue, the
   authors collected and geo-coded data for a representative sample of
   1,568 Ohio ex-prisoners released on community supervision during the
   first six months of 1999. Contextual analysis reveals that race
   difference in serious recidivism is explained by low-skill employment
   opportunity in manufacturing and that it is contingent on levels of
   neighborhood disadvantage and unemployment.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, Xin Xiang investigates what dushu, or ``schooling,{''}
   means for rural senior secondary school students in a high-poverty
   county in southwestern China. With the persistence of China's
   rural-urban education inequality and alarming reports about secondary
   school dropout rates, rural students' and their families' attitudes
   toward schooling have become a topic of academic as well as public
   debate. Drawing from repeated interviews with and observations of
   twenty-seven students conducted over a year, Xiang uses portraiture
   methodology to illustrate the different dimensions of meaning these
   rural youth attach to dushu: the means to a future of comfort and
   dignity, a family responsibility and collective investment, and a path
   toward individual freedom and actualization. This portrait also reveals
   the deep contradictions that define these students' experiences of dushu
   and how it often denies the hopes they attach to it and demands painful
   compromises.}},

Abstract = {{Each year, 1.3 million students fail to graduate, dropping the United
   States' high school graduation rate to 69\%. One of the most salient
   predictors of high school dropout is socio-economic status (SES), which
   makes important an improved understanding of the reasons why SES affects
   educational outcomes. In this study, multilevel mediation models were
   utilized to examine parental investment in school as a mediator of the
   relationship between SES and educational outcomes among an ethnically
   diverse sample of 64,350 7th to 9th grade students from 199 rural
   communities and towns in the U.S. (50\% male, 63\% non-Hispanic White).
   These relationships were assessed at the individual and school district
   level. Results indicate that parental investment is an important
   mediator at both levels. Within school districts, 28\% of the effect of
   SES on the expectation to graduate from high school is mediated by
   perceived parental investment. Between school districts, 60\% of the
   effect of concentrated disadvantage on the district's high school
   graduation rate and nearly all (87\%) of the effect of concentrated
   disadvantage on the average expectation to graduate from high school
   among students in the district is mediated by perceived parental
   investment. Implications for prevention are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Using an ecological model, we describe substance use and sexual risk
   behaviors of young male laborers at a roadside market in Malawi. Data
   included observations and interviews with 18 key market leaders and 15
   laborers (ages 18-25 years). Alcohol, marijuana, and commercial sex
   workers (CSWs) were widely available. We identified three patterns of
   substance use: 6 young men currently used, 6 formerly used, and 3 never
   used. Substance use was linked to risky sex, including sex with CSWs.
   The market supported risky behaviors through availability of resources;
   supportive norms, including beliefs that substance use enhanced
   strength; and lack of restraints. Community-level poverty, cultural
   support for alcohol, interpersonal family/peer influences, early
   substance use, and school dropout also contributed to risky behaviors.
   Parental guidance was protective but not often reported. Local programs
   addressing substance use and risky sex simultaneously and better
   national substance use policies and mental health services are needed.

Abstract = {{This article describes rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP), getting pregnant or
   giving birth again within 24 months of giving birth, in a group of
   unmarried, low-income, African American first-time, adolescent parent
   couples from the perspectives of their kinship systems, that is, the
   adolescent parents and their parents or parental figures. RRP has been
   associated with prematurity, low birth weight, inadequate prenatal care,
   school dropout, increased potential for poverty, and prolonged welfare
   dependence. There were 21 RRPs among 24 kinship systems: 9 adolescent
   males who fathered RRPs with new partners and also reported having been
   denied access to their study babies; 6 adolescent mothers with new
   partners, who also reported intimate partner violence with the study
   adolescent father; and 6 study adolescent parent couples, whose paternal
   family reported doubts about the paternity of the study babies.
   Adolescent fathers should be offered the same child care and
   contraceptive information routinely offered to adolescent mothers.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Anaemia is a major public health problem affecting women
   of reproductive age groups all over the world. As per NFHS-IV data,
   prevalence of anaemia in India is 53\% and in urban areas of West Bengal
   is 58.2\%. Studies conducted among women of reproductive age in slums of
   Mumbai and Bhubaneswar, the prevalence of anaemia was 49.5\% and 60.8\%
   respectively.
   Aim: To assess the nutritional anaemia and its predisposing factors
   among women of reproductive age group in a slum of Kolkata. West Bengal,
   India.
   Materials and Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was
   carried out in a slum of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Total study
   participants enrolled were 122 women of the reproductive age group
   (15-49 years). The surveyed women were gathered in three days through
   three different camps organised in the field service area of Urban
   Health Unit and Training Center, Chetla. All the respondents were
   interviewed and anthropometric measurement and blood examination were
   carried out. Data was analysed using SPSS version 16 and chi-square test
   was used to find out the association between variables.
   Results: Among all women, 112 (91.8\%) had anaemia with proportion of
   mild and moderate anaemia being 67.2\% and 24.6\%, respectively. No
   woman was suffering from severe anaemia. The factors associated with
   anaemia were age, education, socio-economic status, parity, abortion,
   interval between two successive pregnancies less than three years,
   menorrhagia, BMI and dietary habits.
   Conclusion: The current study noted that education level, socioeconomic
   status, consumption of iron rich food, increased order of pregnancies
   and abortion, interval between successive pregnancies affect the blood
   haemoglobin level successively. To increase the health awareness and
   decrease the prevalence of anaemia, community awareness about iron folic
   acid supplementation and schooling of girls, decreasing school dropout
   are to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{While educational success in high school can be linked to elementary
   school achievement, there is little evidence that parent involvement in
   elementary school provides lasting benefits to children through high
   school. Using data from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, this study
   investigated the association between parent involvement in elementary
   school and success in high school. Parent involvement in school (based
   on teacher and parent reports) and parent reports of home involvement
   were used to determine if greater reported parent involvement was
   associated with indicators of school success. Results indicated that
   even after controlling for background characteristics and risk factors,
   parent involvement in school was significantly associated with lower
   rates of high school dropout, increased on-time high school completion,
   and highest grade completed. This study suggests that parent involvement
   in school is an important component in early childhood education to help
   promote long-term effects. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   School Noncompletion}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{While research shows growing up in urban neighborhoods increases the
   likelihood of not completing high school, it remains unclear what
   mechanism facilitates this process and why some youth are more
   vulnerable than others. This study addresses this gap by drawing on
   interviews with male, Latino high school graduates and non-completers in
   Los Angeles. Interviews reveal urban violence is the most salient
   feature of urban neighborhoods and consequential for school completion.
   In an effort to avoid victimization male youth exposed to urban violence
   draw on male peer ties for protection. Inherent in these social ties, as
   in other forms of social capital, are expectations and obligations. I
   find that an orientation that privileges these expectations and
   obligations-and not specifically an anti-school orientation-gets male
   youth ``caught up{''} in behavior counterproductive to school
   completion, like being truant with peers and getting expelled for
   ``backing them{''} in a fight. I find not all urban youth adopt this
   orientation because youth are differentially exposed to the
   neighborhood. Family and school institutional factors limit some youth's
   time in the neighborhood, buffering them from urban violence. These
   youth then bypass the opportunity and need to draw on male peer ties for
   protection. Not having to employ these ``strategies of action,{''} they
   avoid getting ``caught up{''} and experience higher chances to graduate.
   This study argues that to understand the cultural orientation that
   guides behavior that contributes to school noncompletion requires
   accounting for how the threat of violence punctuates and organizes the
   daily lives of male urban youth.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the intergenerational transmission of social disadvantages in
   the context of the Finnish welfare state. Previous research on
   intergenerational transmission has typically concentrated on educational
   attainment, income and social class as separate factors. Researchers
   commonly measure parental standing using single indicators that are very
   general and do not address social disadvantage; rather, these single
   indicators only address socioeconomic status in general. Therefore, we
   measure both parental disadvantage and children's outcomes using three
   indicators: dropping out of school after completing compulsory
   education, unemployment, and receipt of social assistance. We assume
   that there are differences in how strongly different disadvantage
   indicators are intergenerationally inherited and how they accumulate
   across generations. We use high-quality register data from Finland (n =
   157 135). Parental information was collected when each child was 15
   years old, and the young adulthood outcomes were collected when the
   child was 22. We analyze data with sibling methods using random-effect
   linear regression models to study the importance of a disadvantaged
   background on adulthood outcomes. According to the results, all three
   social disadvantages are intergenerationally inherited in Finland.
   Accumulation of disadvantage, receipt of social assistance and dropping
   out of school after compulsory education are inherited more strongly
   than unemployment. The lack of economic resources in the family does not
   explain why other family disadvantages are transferred across
   generations. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{Academic studies show that one of the main predictors of early school
   dropout at secondary education is student truancy behaviour, usually
   beginning at primary education. This is a problem that gets worse in
   socially vulnerable environments. This study analyses the prevalence and
   types of truancy in a population of students with high social risk in
   Madrid city, studying the relationship between truancy and their school
   performance. A questionnaire was answered by mentor teachers of students
   at the preschool and primary stages (N = 120), who reported information
   from a total of 433 students from 12 different schools. Results showed a
   high level of prevalence in the different types of truancy (Active and
   Passive). Among these behaviours, 46.86\% of students skipped entire
   days without a valid excuse and 42.51\% did not usually do their
   homework. Overall, 60\% showed underachievement and great rates of
   curricular gap. In 6th grade, the last year of primary school, 74.42\%
   of students had repeated one grade and 27.91\% more than one. Moreover,
   significant correlations were found between truancy and school
   performance. The detection and early action against truancy in primary
   education with this type of student will reduce early dropouts and make
   school a key actor for the development of these students.}},

Abstract = {{Youth of color are disproportionately likely to grow-up in poor,
   disadvantaged neighborhoods characterized by high levels of psychosocial
   stressors and inadequate supportive resources. Poverty and racial
   minority status correlate with an increased risk of high-school dropout,
   teen pregnancy, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted infections
   (STIs). Given these trends, child welfare researchers are developing
   various interventions to increase the protective resources and social
   opportunities available to youth of color. This article reports results
   of a preliminary, qualitative study that investigated the feasibility
   and acceptability of an economic empowerment intervention in the South
   Bronx and East Harlem, New York Using focus groups and brief
   questionnaires with youth and their parents/guardians (N = 24 dyads), we
   explored attitudes toward youth educational savings accounts, financial
   planning classes, and mentorship for inner-city youth. Findings indicate
   a strong interest in an economic empowerment intervention among
   adolescents and their caregivers in these communities. These findings
   have implications for the design of larger-scale research programs that
   aim to improve inner-city youth's socio-economic wellbeing using
   economic empowerment models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{School mobility has been shown to increase the risk of poor achievement,
   behavior problems, grade retention, and high school dropout. Using data
   over 25 years from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, we investigated the
   unique risk of school moves on a variety of young adult outcomes
   including educational attainment, occupational prestige, depression
   symptoms, and criminal arrests. We also investigated how the timing of
   school mobility, whether earlier or later in the academic career, may
   differentially predict these outcomes over and above associated risks.
   Results indicate that students who experience more school changes
   between kindergarten and 12th grade are less likely to complete high
   school on time, complete fewer years of school, attain lower levels of
   occupational prestige, experience more symptoms of depression, and are
   more likely to be arrested as adults. Furthermore, the number of school
   moves predicted outcomes above and beyond associated risks such as
   residential mobility and family poverty. When timing of school mobility
   was examined, results indicated more negative outcomes associated with
   moves later in the grade school career, particularly between 4th and 8th
   grades.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: School truancy, school failure, and dropout are highly
   correlated with delinquency and criminality. There are also racial
   inequalities regarding the relationship between education and crime. The
   current study asks, ``What risk do demographic, academic, and behavioral
   factors contribute to later adult justice system contact for urban youth
   residing in Louisiana?{''}
   Method: Using administrative data from the Louisiana Department of
   Education, the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice, and the Louisiana
   Department of Public Safety and Corrections (LADOC), hierarchical,
   mixed-effects logistic regression models (N = 507,613) explored whether
   youth later encountered the LADOC and were incarcerated, and whether
   they committed a violent crime leading to their contact.
   Results: The most significant predictors of any adult contact with the
   LADOC were being male (p < .01; odds ratio {[}OR] 4.74), contact with
   the state Office of Juvenile Justice (p < .01, OR 3.742), and school
   expulsion (p < .01, OR 2.46). The most significant predictors of adult
   incarceration were being male (p < .01, OR 9.932), contact with the
   state Office of Juvenile Justice (p <. 01, OR 4.637), and expulsion (p <
   .01, OR 2.368). The most significant predictors of contact with the
   LADOC after a violent crime were being male (p < .01, O.R. 7.726),
   contact with the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice (p < .01, OR
   3.606), and being African American (p < .01, OR 2.651).
   Conclusions: Despite its intent, punishment-oriented approaches such as
   suspension, expulsion, and the juvenile justice system seem to encourage
   further deviant behavior among youth. Reform is necessary to decrease
   adult criminality for those engaging in risky behavior during
   adolescence. Additional considerations must be made for youth from
   disadvantaged backgrounds.}},

Abstract = {{Parental separation is linked to multiple negative outcomes for children
   in all spheres of life. A field study was designed to estimate the
   epidemiology and to quantify the outcomes on the wellbeing of children
   from separated parents. Thus, data on socio-economic status,
   psychological adjustment, behavioral disorders, social relations,
   self-concept, and academic achievement were gathered from 346 children
   and adolescents, 173 separated parents, and 173 parents from intact
   families in the paediatric catchment area of Galicia (Spain). The
   results showed that parental separation had a significant negative
   impact on the childrens and adolescents family income (increasing the
   probability of falling below the poverty line); psychological adjustment
   (i.e., higher scores in anxiety, depression, hostility, paranoid
   ideation, and interpersonal alienation); social relations (i.e., less
   self-control in social relations; higher social withdrawal);
   self-concept (lower levels of academic, emotional, physical, and family
   self-concept), and academic achievement (lower academic achievement with
   higher school dropout rates). Moreover, children from separated families
   had a higher probability of being exposed to gender violence.
   Epidemiologically, parental separation is associated to the probability
   of falling below the poverty line 33.9\%; being exposed to gender
   violence 43.2\%; and symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hostility,
   paranoid ideation interpersonal alienation, and social withdrawal, i.e.,
   20, 17, 27, 20, 19, and 35.5\%, respectively. Inversely, self-control in
   social relations, and academic, emotional, physical, and family
   self-concept fell to 16, 32, 27, 22, and 37\%, respectively. The
   interrelationship among these variables and the implications of these
   results for interventions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Offspring of depressed women have high rates of depressive
   symptoms and other psychopathology. The authors examined the
   relationship of mothers' symptoms of depression and anxiety reported
   during their offspring's childhood and adolescence on depressive
   disorder and educational achievement of their adult children. Method:
   The data come from a longitudinal cohort study of first graders from
   Woodlawn, a neighborhood in Chicago, followed from age 6 to 32 years (N
   = 879). Adult children's depression and educational attainment are
   regressed on earlier self-reports of mothers' psychological distress.
   Using multiple logistic regression, the authors controlled for the
   relationships of poverty, mothers' education, mobility, family
   structure, mothers' illness, and children's first grade classroom
   behavior and psychological symptoms. Results: Daughters of mothers with
   persistent maternal psychological distress had two and a half times the
   risk of lifetime depressive disorder, but no increased risk of high
   school dropout. For sons, mothers' psychological distress was not
   related to depression but was related to poorer educational attainment.
   Conclusions: Mothers' depressed feelings during the childrearing years
   relate to their children's depression and educational attainment as
   measured in adulthood. The patterns differ for sons and daughters.}},

Abstract = {{Regardless of remarkable educational achievements for over the last 20
   years, the academic attainment of Vietnam's ethnic minority students
   continues to lag behind that of majority students. At upper-secondary
   education, not only has the educational disparity persisted, but it has
   increased over time. Recent studies have found ethnic minority students
   have to face many challenges including poor family socioeconomic
   background, long distances to school, poor school quality, and
   linguistic and cultural barriers. Despite challenges, some ethnic
   minority youths do enroll in and complete their upper-secondary
   education. Therefore, understanding how ethnic minority students manage
   to overcome barriers and succeed educationally can provide important
   insights regarding the means that policymakers, educators, and parents
   can pursue in order to address the educational disparity. The resilience
   literature exploring association between household adversities and
   children's responses indicates that hardship does not always result in
   detrimental effects. This study used a mixed-methods approach and
   explored data from the Families and Communities in Transition study to
   examine risks and factors promoting upper secondary education among the
   Thai youth, the second largest ethnic minority group in Vietnam. The
   study found that poverty, low educated parents, low parental engagement
   in child's education, school distance, being bullied, teased, and
   induced to dropout were challenges to ethnic minority's upper-secondary
   school. More importantly, the study provided supporting evidence for a
   positive attitude toward schooling and effective support from their
   parents, relatives, school and in-school peers can prevent ethnic
   minority student from school dropout and promote their educational
   success.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Adolescent parenthood is a major challenge in low-and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the vast majority of the
   evidence has focused on adolescent motherhood. Little is known about
   adolescent fatherhood in LMICs. The aim of this study was to examine the
   determinants of early fatherhood and its consequences on a range of
   outcomes among adolescent males.
   Methods: This study used three waves of longitudinal data from the
   multicountry Young Lives cohort study, specifically following a sample
   of 1,779 adolescent boys at ages 15,19, and 22 years in Ethiopia, India,
   Peru, and Vietnam. Individual fixed effects models were conducted to
   investigate the sociodemographic determinants of adolescent fatherhood
   and the consequences of adolescent fatherhood on males' education,
   health, psychosocial well-being, and time use outcomes.
   Results: The results indicated that lower educational attainment,
   absence of the adolescent's mother and father from the home, larger
   household size, and poverty increased the likelihood of becoming an
   adolescent father by age 22 years. The results revealed that becoming an
   adolescent father was associated with a higher likelihood of school
   dropout, being overweight, smoking, greater internalizing problems, and
   less time spent on leisure activities and more time spent on caregiving
   responsibilities.
   Conclusions: Highlighting the experiences of young men as adolescent
   parents in LMICs, findings underscore the importance of prevention
   strategies to delay early parenthood for adolescent boys and
   multicomponent interventions to support young fathers and their unique
   health, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral needs.

   poverty (n = 10 971, and n = 14 928). SNAP participation was found to
   moderate the association between material deprivation and grade

Abstract = {{Each year the Tax Foundation releases rankings of U S states on time to
   Tax Freedom, or the day that the average taxpayer has met their tax
   burden. The current analysis sought to contextualize the tax freedom day
   rankings, by examining the association between state tax burden and key
   indicators of child wellbeing. The 2009 measure of days to tax freedom
   by state was correlated with ten key indicators of child wellbeing from
   the Casey Foundation's KIDS COUNT 2009 data. Each of the wellbeing
   indicators and the overall composite wellbeing rankings were also
   regressed on days to Tax Freedom and Gross State Product. As the days to
   tax freedom decrease, indicating a lighter tax burden, all of the
   following increase significantly the infant mortality rate, child and
   teen death rates, teen birth rate, rates of school dropout and
   disconnected youth, and numbers of children in poverty These findings
   all held even after controlling for Gross State Product. Public
   attitudes and choices about paying taxes have important consequences for
   the health of children in our society. The broad appeal of Tax Freedom
   Day highlights a disconnect between the act of paying taxes and
   recognition of the benefits to children those taxes provide. (C) 2010

   Pregnancy and maternity during this period involves different
   consequences to personal, family and social level. Stressing question as
   mortality, morbidity, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, school
   dropout, positions of vulnerability, poverty reproduction, etc. On the
   other hand there are factors that favor the existence of this problem
   such as: geographical, social and family and individual issues, public
   policies, existing resources, the educational level or knowledge about,
   styles of unhealthy lifestyle, early marriage the traditional gender
   roles assigned to women, etc.
   Using as shown in 6 mothers at an early age and 6 parents of teenage
   mothers Metropolitan Area of Monterrey, a qualitative research arises
   through content analysis and categorization of interviews with the aim
   of identifying perceptions have regarding pregnancy early age. As well
   as the causes, consequences and measures in place.
   The results show the manifestation of different individual causes,
   political, social and family in the sample, as well as various
   individual consequences both as family. It also shows that the school is
   the main source of information. That is why intends to review the

Abstract = {{Central goals of system-of-care initiatives for children and families
   have been to decrease the use of restrictive services while increasing
   the use of community-based resources. However, the menu of appropriate
   community services must in part be based on characteristics of children
   and families presenting within a particular community and may differ by
   urban and nonurban residence. The present study aimed to compare
   characteristics of child and adolescent clients from urban and nonurban
   communities in an attempt to begin to inform the development of
   appropriate community programming. Using intake data from all referrals
   to the 23 systems of care in Connecticut from July 1, 200 1, to June 30,
   2002, comparisons were made between youth from urban and nonurban areas.
   Analyses demonstrated lower rates of bipolar disorder, hospital and
   foster-home placement and higher levels of caregiver-reported
   intrapersonal strength and general child functioning among urban
   compared to nonurban youth. That these differences could not be
   attributed to correlates of urban residence, such as income, ethnicity,
   child poverty, high school dropout rates, and crowding, suggests the
   possibility that as yet unexamined variables might mitigate these risk
   factors. The continued examination of group differences meant to inform
   this important issue is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In Argentina adolescent pregnancy is still regarded as a public health
   problem or a ``social epidemic{''} However, it is necessary to ask from
   which perspective and for whom it is a problem, and what type of
   problem. This article presents the findings of a large quantitative and
   qualitative study conducted in five Northern provinces and two
   metropolitan areas of Argentina in 2003-2004. Based on the results of a
   survey of adolescent mothers (n=7,645) and ten focus group discussions
   with adolescent girls and boys, it addresses the connections between
   school dropout, pregnancy and poverty, and makes recommendations on how
   to tailor health care and sexuality education to address local
   realities. The findings indicate a need to develop educational
   activities to promote safer sex and address gender power relations in
   programmes working with deprived communities. Sexuality education with a
   gender and rights perspective, and increasing accessibility to
   contraceptive methods for adolescent girls and boys is also crucial.
   Antenatal and post-partum care, as well as post-abortion core, should be
   improved for young women and viewed as opportunities for contraceptive
   counselling and provision. Male participation in pregnancy prevention
   and care also needs to be promoted. (C) 2008 Reproductive Health

Title = {{Obesity-related behaviors among poor adolescents and young adults: is
   social position associated with risk behaviors?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This cross-sectional study examines multiple dimensions of social
   position in relation to obesity-related behaviors in an adolescent and
   young adult population. In addition to using conventional measures of
   social position, including parental education and household
   expenditures, we explore the usefulness of three youth-specific measures
   of social position community and society subjective social status and
   school dropout status. Data are taken from a 2004 house-to-house survey
   of urban households within the bottom 20th percentile of income
   distribution within seven states in Mexico. A total of 5,321 Mexican
   adolescents, aged 12-22 years, provided information on obesity-related
   behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior) and
   indicators of subjective and objective social position. A parent in each
   household provided information on socioeconomic status of the parent and
   household. Ordinal logistic regressions are used to estimate the
   associations of parental, household and adolescent indicators of social
   position and obesity-related risk behaviors. Those adolescents with the
   highest odds of adopting obesity risk behaviors were the ones who
   perceived themselves as lower in social status in reference to their
   peer community and those who had dropped out of school. We found no
   significant associations between parental education or household
   expenditures and obesity related risk behaviors. Immediate social
   factors in adolescents' lives may have a strong influence on their
   health-related behaviors. This study provides evidence for the
   usefulness of two particular measures, both of which are youth-specific.
   Adolescents and young adults who have dropped out of school and those
   with lower perceived relative social position within their community are
   more likely to be at-risk for obesity-related behaviors than those with
   higher relative social position. We conclude that youth-specific
   measures may be important in identifying the most at-risk among
   relatively homogeneous populations of youth.}},

Abstract = {{Because most youth are enrolled in school for many years before they
   initiate sex and when they initiate sex, schools have the potential for
   reducing adolescent sexual risk-taking. This paper reviews studies which
   examine the impact upon sexual risk-taking of school involvement, school
   characteristics, specific programs in school that do not address sexual
   behavior, and specific programs that do address sexual risk-taking.
   Multiple studies support several conclusions. First, involvement in and
   attachment to school and plans to attend higher education are all
   related to less sexual risk-taking and lower pregnancy rates. Second,
   students in schools with manifestations of poverty and disorganization
   are more likely to become pregnant. Third, some school programs
   specifically designed to increase attachment to school or reduce school
   dropout effectively delayed sex or reduced pregnancy rate, even when
   they may not address sexuality. Fourth, sex and HIV education programs
   do not increase sexual behavior, and some programs decrease sexual
   activity, and increase condom or contraceptive use. Fifth, school-based
   clinics and school condom-availability programs do not increase sexual
   activity, and either may or may not increase condom or contraceptive
   use. Other studies reveal that there is very broad support for
   comprehensive sex-and HIV-education programs, and accordingly, most
   youth receive some amount of sex or HIV education. However, important
   topics are not covered in many schools.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the issue of school dropout in six communities in
   the Savelugu-Nanton District in the Northern Region of Ghana. The study
   focused on 89 children (64 boys and 25 girls) aged 7-16 years, who had
   dropped out of school. A snowballing sampling method was employed to
   recruit participants to the study. Two researchers interviewed the
   children using semi-structured interview schedules over a period of
   three weeks. School dropouts were asked to tell their own stories about
   their schooling experiences and the factors which led to them leaving
   school. From their accounts dropping out of school appears to be the
   result of a series of events involving a range of interrelated factors,
   rather than a single factor. The complex nature of the processes leading
   to dropout demands input from various actors (i.e. teachers, head
   teachers, parent-teacher associations, school management committees and
   community members) to detect and address at-risk factors early in order
   to reduce the likelihood of dropout.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to identify the somatic and functional profile of
   middle-school students from three areas of Romania (South-West, West and
   North-West). A group of 364 students (173 girls and 191 boys) aged
   between 10 and 16 years (12.75 +/- 1.2) from 6 different schools in
   Mehedinti, Caras-Severin and Bistrita-Nasaud counties took part in this
   study. The target group category includes Roma ethnic students, students
   from disorganised families and students at high risk of early school
   dropout, from both urban and rural areas. The calculated statistical
   indicators were: arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of
   variation and Pearson coefficient. The anthropometric measurements made
   to identify the somatic and functional profile of students were height,
   weight, BMI, arm span and Ruffier test. The results show an upward trend
   in the height of boys aged between 10 (1.44 m) and 16 years (1.67 m),
   the maximum value recorded for girls aged 14 years being 1.59 m. The
   highest value of body weight was identified in boys aged 15 years (58.91
   kg) and girls aged 14 years (52.63 kg). The highest value for arm span
   was found for 15-years-old boys (167 cm) and 14-years-old girls (158.83
   cm). BMI values for both boys and girls were between 17.22 and 21.52
   points. In Ruffier test, the scores obtained by students ranged between
   9.95 and 13.4. This research is part of the ``Sustainable social and
   education integration through sport activities{''} project (PNP001).}},

Abstract = {{Youth aging out of foster care are at particular risk for negative
   outcomes including school dropout, homelessness, poverty, unemployment,
   substance abuse, health and mental health problems, and victimization.
   Yet we know little about how, when, and why these youth find themselves
   on a downward trajectory. This qualitative, phenomenological
   study-conducted in partnership with four public child welfare
   agencies-examined the lived experience of 19 youth during their first
   year after exiting foster care. The authors used monthly,
   contemporaneous interviews to explore domains including housing,
   employment, education, and relationships with trusted adults. Although
   outcomes in employment were poorest, participants' experience in all
   domains was characterized by frequent changes and instability. Adverse
   events began immediately and many youth were unsure how to navigate the
   system to get help. Yet youth who were successful in one domain were
   more likely to be successful in others. Risk factors included having
   four or more foster care placements, being on probation, accumulating
   fines, and losing government assistance. Protective factors included
   living with an adult who shares the rent and maintains a positive,
   consistent presence; being a full-time student; receiving educational
   and housing subsidies; having reliable means of transportation and
   communication; and maintaining the same job throughout the transitional
   year. Despite facing significant obstacles, the youth demonstrated
   resilience and optimism as they contemplated their futures.
   Recommendations include providing specialized services that target youth
   as they exit the system, and emphasizing stability rather than
   self-sufficiency.}},

   Incidence in a Large Metropolitan County, 1994-2002}},

Abstract = {{The presence of street gangs has been hypothesized as influencing
   overall levels of violence in urban communities through a process of
   gun-drug diffusion and cross-type homicide. This effect is said to act
   independently of other known correlates of violence, i.e., neighborhood
   poverty. To test this hypothesis, we independently assessed the impact
   of population exposure to local street gang densities on 8-year homicide
   rates in small areas of Los Angeles County, California. Homicide data
   from the Los Angeles County Coroners Office were analyzed with original
   field survey data on street gang locations, while controlling for the
   established covariates of community homicide rates. Bivariate and
   multivariate regression analyses explicated strong relationships between
   homicide rates, gang density, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic
   structure. Street gang densities alone had cumulative effects on small
   area homicide rates. Local gang densities, along with high school
   dropout rates, high unemployment rates, racial and ethnic concentration,
   and higher population densities, together explained 90\% of the
   variation in local 8-year homicide rates. Several other commonly
   considered covariates were insignificant in the model. Urban
   environments with higher densities of street gangs exhibited higher
   overall homicide rates, independent of other community covariates of
   homicide. The unique nature of street gang killings and their greater
   potential to influence future local rates of violence suggests that more
   direct public health interventions are needed alongside traditional
   criminal justice mechanisms to combat urban violence and homicides.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses administrative records for the state of Wisconsin as
   well as Zillow Real Estate data on median house values to examine the
   associations between the regularity of child support receipt on moves
   and changes in housing values following moves. Our sample consists of 13
   329 custodial mothers with new orders from 2002 to 2006. Across several
   measures of child support and specifications of moves, regular receipt
   is negatively associated with any moves and with more than one move a
   year, holding constant the value of the child support received. In
   models examining associations between regularity and changes in housing
   quality after a move, an additional month of child support within 25 per
   cent of the order amount is associated with an \$890 increase in housing
   value. These results imply that policy-makers concerned with housing
   stability consider both the regularity and absolute value of child
   support when considering family well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy among adolescent girls in Zambia is a significant concern on
   its own and as a factor in school dropout and early marriage, with
   one-third of girls aged 15-19 having experienced pregnancy. Using
   qualitative and quantitative data from the Adolescent Girls Empowerment
   Program, we explore transactional sex as a driver of adolescent
   pregnancy. In qualitative interviews, transactional sex was repeatedly
   discussed as the main driver of pregnancy, as respondents indicated that
   when a girl feels that she ``owes{''} a man sex, it prevents her from
   declining sex or using condoms. In addition, multivariate Cox
   proportional hazards models using four rounds of longitudinal data from
   a sample of unmarried and never pregnant adolescent girls (n=1,853) show
   that girls who have engaged in transactional sex face a hazard of first
   premarital pregnancy almost 30 percent greater than their peers who have
   not, independent of the effect of other risk-related sexual behaviors
   such as condom use and number of sexual partners. Identifying and
   understanding the role of transactional sex in adolescent pregnancy is
   important for designing effective curricula and programs that delay
   pregnancy, and highlights the importance of addressing access to
   economic resources in adolescent health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background Poverty, family stability, and social policies influence the
   ability of adolescents to attend school. Likewise, being enrolled in
   school may shape an adolescent's risk for HIV and pregnancy. We
   identified trends in school enrollment, factors predicting school
   enrollment (antecedents), and health risks associated with staying in or
   leaving school (consequences).
   Methods Data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) were examined
   for adolescents 15-19 years (n=21, 735 person-rounds) from 1994 to 2013.
   Trends, antecedents, and consequences were assessed using logistic and
   linear regression with robust variance estimation. Qualitative data were
   used to explore school leaving among HIV+ and HIV-youths (15-24 years).
   Results School enrollment and socioeconomic status (SES) rose steadily
   from 1994 to 2013 among adolescents; orphan-hood declined after
   availability of antiretroviral therapy. Antecedent factors associated
   with school enrollment included age, SES, orphanhood, marriage, family
   size, and the percent of family members <20 years. In qualitative
   interviews, youths reported lack of money, death of parents, and
   pregnancy as primary reasons for school dropout. Among adolescents,
   consequences associated with school enrollment included lower HIV
   prevalence, prevalence of sexual experience, and rates of alcohol use
   and increases in consistent condom use. Young women in school were more
   likely to report use of modern contraception and never being pregnant.
   Young men in school reported fewer recent sexual partners and lower
   rates of sexual concurrency.
   Conclusions Rising SES and declining orphanhood were associated with
   rising school enrollment in Rakai. Increasing school enrollment was
   associated with declining risk for HIV and pregnancy.}},

   program for urban youth: Rationale, design, and methods}},
Journal = {{CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Youth in disadvantaged urban areas are frequently exposed
   to chronic stress and trauma, including housing instability,
   neighborhood violence, and other poverty-related adversities. These
   exposures increase risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems
   and ultimately, school dropout. Schools are a promising setting in which
   to address these issues; however, there are few universal,
   trauma-informed school-based interventions for urban youth.
   Methods/Design: Project POWER (Promoting Options for Wellness and
   Emotion Regulation) is a randomized controlled trial testing the impact
   of RAP Club, a trauma-informed intervention for eighth graders that
   includes mindfulness as a core component. Students in 32 urban public
   schools (n = 800) are randomly assigned to either RAP Club or a health
   education active control group. We assess student emotional, behavioral,
   and academic outcomes using self-report surveys and teacher ratings at
   baseline, post-intervention, and 4-month follow up. Focus groups and
   interviews with students, teachers, and principals address program
   feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity, as well as perceived program
   impacts. Students complete an additional self-report survey in ninth
   grade. Schools provide students' academic and disciplinary data for
   their seventh, eighth, and ninth grade years. In addition, data on
   program costs are collected to conduct an economic analysis of the
   intervention and active control programs.
   Discussion: Notable study features include program co-leadership by
   young adults from the community and building capacity of school
   personnel for continued program delivery. In addition to testing program
   impact, we will identify factors related to successful program
   implementation to inform future program use and dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{Background: As populations of refugee children increase globally,
   strategies for providing quality and relevant educational experiences
   for this group of children has become a priority. This is because
   research suggests that refugee children tend to experience higher school
   dropout rates due to, among other factors, poverty, lack of shelter and
   inadequate nutrition.
   Aim: This article reports on an exploratory study of Grade R teachers'
   interactions with refugee children in a child care centre in Durban and
   the ways in which these might contribute to the children's readiness for
   Grade 1 in mainstream schools.
   Setting: The study was located in a Grade R class in a Durban refugee
   child care centre catering for children from neighbouring African
   countries.
   Methods: The study adopted a qualitative ethnographic approach involving
   classroom and playground observations, as well as informal open-ended
   interviews with the Grade R teacher and her assistant.
   Results: The findings suggest that several factors, including a high
   teacher-learner ratio (1:48), poor classroom management and pedagogical
   practices, inadequate and inappropriate resources and a lack of
   professional development opportunities for teachers influenced the
   nature of interactions between the refugee children and their teachers.
   Conclusions: The findings have negative implications for the children's
   readiness for Grade 1 and beyond. The findings suggest that unless the
   provision of early childhood development and education (ECDE) in this
   centre is significantly improved, for example, by addressing the factors
   identified in the study, the refugee children in the facility will
   continue to be poorly prepared for mainstream schooling.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTeen pregnancy is associated with increased risk of school
   dropout, employment challenges and long-term poverty; these risks are
   exacerbated for foster youth who are at elevated risk for teen
   pregnancy. Sex education and relationship education can facilitate the
   development of attitudes and skills associated with behaviors that
   reduce risky sexual behaviors. However, research on sex education with
   foster youth is limited as is research exploring the potential benefits
   of combining relationship education with sex education.ObjectiveThis
   study examines variations in the experiences and outcomes of non-foster
   youth (n=160) and foster youth (n=165) who participated in a federally
   funded teen pregnancy prevention program that included both relationship
   and sex education.MethodsPath analysis models examined the relationship
   between several exogenous variables (i.e., youth characteristics,
   pre-program risky sexual behavior, program experience) and three
   endogenous variables (i.e., post-program perceived change in
   intercourse, condom use, and contraceptive use intentions). Multi-group
   analyses were used with foster youth status as a moderator to determine
   if the model was invariant by foster youth status.ResultsAlthough foster
   youth entered programming with elevated rates of risky sexual behavior,
   both groups reported positive program experiences and safer sexual
   behavior intentions post-programming.ConclusionRegardless of their
   elevated rates of risky sexual behavior prior to receiving programming,
   foster youth, like non-foster youth, may benefit from both relationship
   and sex education. For foster youth specifically, their positive program
   experience and reduced intentions to engage in risky sexual behaviors is
   an encouraging finding that contrasts with existing literature.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to increase understanding of the clustering
   of sexual behaviors in an urban sample of emerging adults, and the
   individual and neighborhood factors associated with sexual behavior
   patterns to provide insight into reducing the disproportionate burden of
   poor sexual outcomes among urban African Americans.
   Methods: We draw on 2 cohorts of urban, predominantly African American
   youth first assessed at age 6 years and follow-up to emerging adulthood
   (mean age, 20 years; n = 1618). Latent class analyses by gender
   identified co-occurrence of sexual behavior.
   Results: We found 3 classes for both males and females: high-risk (13\%
   of males, 15\% of females), low-risk (54\% of males, 56\% of females)
   and no-risk (33\% of males, 29\% of females). Membership in the
   high-risk class was associated with school dropout, a substance use
   disorder diagnosis, having a criminal arrest, pregnancy, and sexually
   transmitted diseases for both males and females. High-risk females also
   had higher rates of depression. Low-risk males and females also had
   elevated risk of pregnancy and parenthood. Neighborhood factors
   distinguished the high-and no-risk classes for males and females,
   including the neighborhood environment scale, which assessed poverty,
   safety, drug activity, and crime/violence in the neighborhood.
   Neighborhood religiosity was inversely associated with membership in the
   high-risk class compared with the no-risk class for females only.
   Neighborhood racism distinguished those in the high-risk class compared
   with the no-risk class for males.
   Conclusions: Future work should take into account the clustering of
   sexual risk behaviors. Specific neighborhood factors could be addressed
   to reduce sexual health disparities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between
   individual/family and neighborhood socioeconomic distress, pain, and
   functional outcomes in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We
   hypothesized that both individual economic distress as well as residence
   in neighborhoods of severe economic distress would predict children's
   level of pain-related functional disability and health-related quality
   of life (HRQOL). Participants (mean age, 12.14 years; 57\% male, n = 56)
   were recruited from an outpatient hematology clinic at a Midwestern
   tertiary referral hospital. Questionnaires assessing pain, depression,
   functional disability, and HRQOL were completed by children and their
   caregivers. Individual socioeconomic data including parental education
   and family income were reported by caregivers. Neighborhood
   socioeconomic distress was identified using publicly available census
   tract data and was based on neighborhood poverty, female head of
   household, male unemployment, and high school dropout levels.
   Multivariate regression analyses revealed that individual/family
   socioeconomic distress was a significant predictor of children's
   functional disability and physical and psychosocial HRQOL. Neighborhood
   socioeconomic distress emerged as a significant independent predictor of
   physical HRQOL only, where living in a distressed neighborhood predicted
   diminished physical HRQOL. Findings suggest that individual
   socioeconomic status and neighborhood economic distress play similar but
   independent roles in predicting children's functional outcomes related
   to SCD pain.
   Perspective: Little is known about the influence of either
   individual/family or neighborhood socioeconomic factors on pain and
   functioning in children with SCD. Our findings suggest that
   socioeconomic distress defined at both the individual level and at the
   neighborhood/community level are significant independent predictors of
   pain-related disability and HRQOL in children with SCD. (C) 2008 by the

Abstract = {{Entertainment-education (E-E) approaches for young audiences continue to
   evolve in order to keep stride with younger generations' affinity for
   technology. E-E and novelas have been used with a wide variety of
   audiences in the United States, in particular hard-to-reach Latino
   populations, and have demonstrated effectiveness in disseminating
   culturally relevant prevention information for a wide variety of
   health-related risk factors and behaviors. This study discusses the
   formative research and active engagement of Latino youth living in
   Langley Park, Maryland, for the development and filming of an innovative
   6-episode webnovela titled Victor and Erika (V\&E). V\&E is part of a
   larger branding strategy of the Adelante Positive Youth Development
   intervention that seeks to prevent substance abuse, sexual risk, and
   interpersonal violence among Latino youth; V\&E is also an intervention
   component. The V\&E webnovela is a dramatic portrayal of the lives of 2
   immigrant Latino teenagers that also disseminates risk prevention
   messages. The storyline represents the turning the corner (to a better
   life) theme that underlies the Adelante intervention brand. Formative
   research was conducted for character development (n=20) and creative
   development of the episodes (n=14). Results of the formative research
   showed that youth recommended inclusion of the following topics in V\&E
   episodes: sex, unintended pregnancy, fidelity, trust, family dynamics,
   immigration status, violence, school dropout, respect, home life, and
   poverty. Detailed character and episode descriptions are provided, and
   the implications of using the V\&E series as a tool for in-person and
   online engagement of youth and the dissemination of prevention messages
   are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data from the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing
   Demonstration were used to examine (a) if moving from high- to
   low-poverty neighborhoods (via randomization) was associated with
   low-income minority children's achievement, grade retention, and
   suspensions/expulsions; (b) if moving minimized gender differences in
   these outcomes; and (c) potential mediators of observed program effects.
   Data on school-age children (mean age = 11.79 years, SD = 3.26) were
   obtained from standardized assessments and parent and adolescent
   interviews during the New York City site's 3-year follow-up evaluation
   (N = 588). Moving to low-poverty neighborhoods had positive effects on
   11-18-year-old boys' achievement scores compared with those of their
   peers in high-poverty neighborhoods. These male adolescents' scores were
   comparable to females' scores, whereas male adolescents in high-poverty
   neighborhoods scored 10 points lower than female peers. Homework time
   and school safety partially accounted for program effects. From a policy
   perspective, the program benefited disadvantaged male adolescents at
   high risk for dropping out of school.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMalawi has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates
   worldwide; at 141 births/1000 girls it is 3-fold higher than the global
   average. Adolescent pregnancy contributes to poor maternal and neonatal
   outcomes, school dropout, and poverty. In preparation for an
   information, education, and communication (IEC) intervention to reduce
   unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls, formative research was
   conducted to understand how and what sexual and reproductive health
   (SRH) information is shared with girls in southern, rural Malawi, and
   perceptions of such information among key informants.MethodsForty
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with three participant groups:
   adolescent girls (n=18), mothers/female guardians (M/FGs) of adolescent
   girls (n=12), and leaders of initiation rites (n=10). Interviews were
   conducted in 15 villages. Data were analyzed and coded using Dedoose
   7.5.ResultsParticipants widely acknowledged both the health risks and
   the general social unacceptability of early childbearing, yet adolescent
   pregnancy is common in the region. Respondents also acknowledged the
   importance of female school completion and the norm that pregnancy
   usually marks the end of a girl's education. Unprotected transactional
   sex was reported to be common and driven by poverty. Initiation rites
   were described as prevalent and often encourage girls to practice sex at
   puberty. Contraceptives, and even condoms, were reportedly discouraged
   for adolescents due to concerns about inappropriateness for nulliparous
   and young girls and misconceptions about side effects. Adolescent
   respondents also noted barriers to accessing condoms and contraceptives.
   M/FGs were described as gatekeepers to SRH information and services, and
   many parents reported delaying SRH discussions until after sexual debut
   due to concerns about encouraging sexual activity. Adolescent and M/FG
   participants expressed a desire for role models or outside experts to
   provide SRH education and to promote an alternate vision to adolescent
   motherhood.ConclusionTo improve SRH outcomes for adolescent girls, it is
   critical to engage key stakeholders and create an enabling environment
   so that girls can effectively act on the IEC they receive. Initiation
   counselors remain entrenched information sources; efforts to provide
   them with training on accurate SRH messaging could leverage an existing
   channel. Engaging parents, especially mothers, is crucial to encourage
   earlier SRH education and to gain their acceptance of adolescent access
   to SRH services. Also important is mobilizing the broader community of
   influencers in support of girls' SRH and vision for a healthier future.
   Sensitization messages focusing on the health, educational and economic
   benefits of preventing early pregnancy may overcome misconceptions about
   and barriers to contraceptive use. Finally, fostering girls' aspirations
   for school completion and jobs and other income generating opportunities
   via role models can encourage an alternative to adolescent motherhood.
   Ultimately, poverty and gender inequity reduction is critical for
   long-lasting impact on the SRH of adolescent girls in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Preventing school dropout is a critical feature of the Millennium
   Development Goals. Yet, as primary school enrollments become universal,
   dropout rates in Mexico near 50\% by the end of formal schooling. Using
   a unique, nationally representative data set (Mexico Family Life Survey)
   we track children ages 511 in 2002 to the years 2005-2006 to determine
   how many have students have dropped out of school. We then apply a
   life-course perspective to determine if the influences of family, school
   and macro-factors interact with the child's level of schooling and the
   transition from primary to secondary school. We find that the transition
   to secondary school has the highest dropout rates. Rurality matters most
   during this transition. As family factors are the most predictive
   indicator of dropout, the family's influence is dynamic over time the
   role of mother's education fades while the influence of an unemployed
   father grows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Can Social Protection Improve Sustainable Development Goals for
   Adolescent Health?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The first policy action outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) is the implementation of national social protection systems. This
   study assesses whether social protection provision can impact 17
   indicators of five key health-related SDG goals amongst adolescents in
   South Africa.
   Methods
   We conducted a longitudinal survey of adolescents (10-18 years) between
   2009 and 2012. Census areas were randomly selected in two urban and two
   rural health districts in two South African provinces, including all
   homes with a resident adolescent. Household receipt of social protection
   in the form of `cash' (economic provision) and `care' (psychosocial
   support) social protection, and health-related indicators within five
   SDG goals were assessed. Gender-disaggregated analyses included
   multivariate logistic regression, testing for interactions between
   social protection and socio-demographic covariates, and marginal effects
   models. Findings
   Social protection was associated with significant adolescent risk
   reductions in 12 of 17 gender-disaggregated SDG indicators, spanning SDG
   2 (hunger); SDG 3 (AIDS, tuberculosis, mental health and substance
   abuse); SDG 4 (educational access); SDG 5 (sexual exploitation, sexual
   and reproductive health); and SDG 16 (violence perpetration). For six of
   17 indicators, combined cash plus care showed enhanced risk reduction
   effects. Two interactions showed that effects of care varied by poverty
   level for boys' hunger and girls' school dropout. For tuberculosis, and
   for boys' sexual exploitation and girls' mental health and violence
   perpetration, no effects were found and more targeted or creative means
   will be needed to reach adolescents on these challenging burdens.
   Interpretation
   National social protection systems are not a panacea, but findings
   suggest that they have multiple and synergistic positive associations
   with adolescent health outcomes. Such systems may help us rise to the
   challenges of health and sustainable development.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of dropout
   predictors across time. Two state-level high school graduation panels
   were selected to begin with the seventh and ninth grades but end at the
   same time. The first panel (seventh grade) contained 29,554 students and
   used sixth grade predictors. The second panel (ninth grade) included
   31,641 students and used eighth grade predictors. The predictors studied
   were age, poverty, attendance, gender, and standardized test scores. The
   data were analyzed using logistic regression. All variables were
   predictors of dropping out of high school. Age and poverty proved to be
   the most effective at discriminating between dropouts and graduates
   within each panel. Age became more effective with time. Attendance and
   test scores were stable indicators between panels. Gender predicted
   dropouts for only the ninth grade panel. Eighth graders that were female
   were approximately 22\% less likely to drop out.}},

Abstract = {{Research on neighborhood effects has increasingly focused on how long
   children have lived in a deprived neighborhood during childhood
   (duration), but has typically ignored when in childhood the exposure
   occurred (timing) and whether neighborhood circumstances were improving
   or deteriorating (sequencing). In this article, the authors applied
   sequence analysis to simultaneously capture children's duration, timing,
   and sequencing of exposure to neighborhood (dis)advantage in childhood.
   Logistic regression analysis was subsequently used to test how different
   patterns of exposure are related to teenage parenthood, school dropout,
   and delinquent behavior. Using register data from the Netherlands, an
   entire cohort was followed from birth in 1995 up until age 19 in 2014 (N
   = 168,645, 48.8\% females, 83.2\% native Dutch). Compared to children
   who had lived in a deprived neighborhood throughout childhood, children
   who were exposed to neighborhood deprivation only during adolescence
   were found to be equally likely to become a teenage parent and were even
   more likely to drop out of school. Unexpectedly, children who had lived
   in an affluent neighborhood throughout childhood were most likely to
   engage in delinquent behavior. Possible explanations and implications
   are discussed.}},

Title = {{Adolescents' perceptions and experiences of pregnancy in refugee and
   migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border: a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Adolescent pregnancy remains a global health concern,
   contributing to 11\% of all births worldwide and 23\% of the overall
   burden of disease in girls aged 15-19 years. Premature motherhood can
   create a negative cycle of adverse health, economic and social outcomes
   for young women, their babies and families. Refugee and migrant
   adolescent girls might be particularly at risk due to poverty, poor
   education and health infrastructure, early marriage, limited access to
   contraception and traditional beliefs. This study aims to explore
   adolescents' perceptions and experiences of pregnancy in refugee and
   migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border.
   Methods: In June 2016 qualitative data were collected in one refugee
   camp and one migrant clinic along the Thailand-Myanmar border by
   conducting 20 individual interviews with pregnant refugee and migrant
   adolescents and 4 focus group discussions with husbands, adolescent boys
   and non-pregnant girls and antenatal clinic staff. Inductive thematic
   analysis was used to identify codes and themes emerging from the data.
   Results: Study participants perceived adolescent pregnancy as a
   premature life event that could jeopardise their future. Important
   themes were premarital sex, forced marriage, lack of contraception,
   school dropout, fear of childbirth, financial insecurity, support
   structures and domestic violence. Supportive relationships with mothers,
   husbands and friends could turn this largely negative experience into a
   more positive one. The main underlying reasons for adolescent pregnancy
   were associated with traditional views and stigma on sexual and
   reproductive health issues, resulting in a knowledge gap on
   contraception and life skills necessary to negotiate sexual and
   reproductive choices, in particular for unmarried adolescents.
   Conclusions: Adolescents perceive pregnancy as a challenging life event
   that can be addressed by developing comprehensive adolescent-friendly
   sexual and reproductive health services and education in refugee and
   migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Creating a more
   tolerant and less stigmatising environment in these communities and
   their governing bodies will help to achieve this goal.}},

   small-scale gold mining}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Artisanal and small-scale gold mining operations have been conducted in
   Ghana for centuries. Over time, technological advances in the industry
   occurred and miners separated from large-scale mining and applied this
   knowledge to small-scale or individual mining practices. In March 2017,
   the government responded to a media campaign against environmental
   degradation and placed a ban against water pollution; this ban affected
   all informal gold mining operations because of the chronic use of
   mercury in gold extraction, which contributes to water contamination.
   The unintended consequences of this ban were that approximately 1
   million people lost their jobs. A qualitative study was conducted to
   understand how small-scale gold mining affected female miners and in
   turn, the implications of the ban on these women and their families.
   There were 21 illegal female miners interviewed in Akwatia, Ghana. The
   results from this study confirmed that many female miners used their
   mining money to support their families. Because the ban blocked mining
   employment opportunities, the women were forced into unreliable and
   low-paying alternative jobs and were unable to pay for school fees and
   food. Unfortunately, while the ban may have improved the environment, it
   also contributed to adverse outcomes related to women and children's
   development, like inadequate nutritional needs and school dropout rates;
   thus, bans like this need to be reconsidered and readapted to address
   these immeasurable consequences.}},

Abstract = {{There are tensions within formal education between imparting knowledge
   and the development of skills for handling that knowledge. In the
   primary school sector, the latter can also be squeezed out of the
   curriculum by a focus on basic skills such as literacy and numeracy.
   What happens when an explicit attempt is made to develop young
   children's reasoning-both in terms of their apparent cognitive abilities
   and their basic skills? This paper reports an independent evaluation of
   an in-class intervention called `Philosophy for Children' (P4C), after
   just over one year of schooling. The intervention aims to help children
   become more willing and able to question, reason, construct arguments
   and collaborate with others. A group of 48 volunteer schools were
   randomised to receive P4C (22 schools) or act as a control for one year
   (26). This paper reports the CAT results for all pupils in years 4 and 5
   initially, and the Key Stage 2 attainment in English and Maths for those
   starting in year 5. There was no school dropout. Individual attrition
   from a total of 3,159 pupils was around 11 percent-roughly equal between
   groups. There were small positive `effect' sizes in favour of the P4C
   group in progress in reading (+0.12) and maths (+0.10), and even smaller
   perhaps negligible improvements in CAT scores (+0.07) and writing
   (+0.03). The results for the most disadvantaged (free school eligible)
   pupils were larger for attainment (+0.29 in reading, +0.17 writing and
   +0.20 maths), but not for CATs (-0.02). Observations and interviews
   suggest that the intervention was generally enjoyable and thought to be
   beneficial for pupil confidence. Our conclusion is that, for those
   wishing to improve attainment outcomes in the short term, an emphasis on
   developing reasoning is promising, especially for the poorest students,
   but perhaps not the most effective way forward. However, for those who
   value reasoning for its own sake, this evaluation demonstrates that
   using curriculum time in this way does not damage attainment (and may
   well enhance it and reduce the poverty gradient in attainment), and so
   suggests that something like P4C is an appropriate educational approach.}},

Abstract = {{Teenage pregnancy is a common public health problem worldwide. The
   objective of this ecological study was to investigate the spatial
   association between teenage pregnancy rates and socioeconomic
   characteristics of municipalities in Sao Paulo State, Southeast Brazil.
   We used a Bayesian model with a spatial distribution following a
   conditional autoregressive (CAR) form based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   algorithm. We used data from the Live Birth Information System (SINASC)
   and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Early
   pregnancy was more frequent in municipalities with lower per capital
   gross domestic product (GDP), higher poverty rate, smaller population,
   lower human development index (HDI), and a higher percentage of
   individuals with State social vulnerability index of 5 or 6 (more
   vulnerable). The study demonstrates a significant association between
   teenage pregnancy and socioeconomic indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on the intergenerational effects of unemployment has
   shown that unemployment has short-term negative effects on children's
   schooling ambitions, performance and high school dropout rates. The
   long-term effects on children's educational outcomes, however, are
   mixed. One potentially important limitation of previous studies has been
   that they have ignored the heterogeneous effects of parental
   unemployment on children's education. We study the effects of parental
   unemployment on children's grade point average, enrollment into general
   secondary and tertiary education by comparing the effects according to
   the children's age of exposure and the parental level of education. We
   use high quality Finnish longitudinal register data and sibling
   fixed-effect models to obtain causal effects. We find that parental
   unemployment has negative effects on both children's educational
   enrollment and performance at the educational transitional periods when
   children are an adolescent but parental unemployment is not detrimental
   in early childhood. For general secondary but not for tertiary
   enrollment, children's poorer school performance due to parental
   unemployment explains the effect entirely. Parental unemployment is not
   affecting children general secondary enrollment or school performance
   among higher educated parents. However, children with a higher educated
   parent exposed to unemployment are less likely to enroll in tertiary
   education. The reduced amount of parental economic resources due to
   unemployment cannot explain any of these effects. This calls for other
   forms of support for children at crucial periods when educational
   decisions are made.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the impact of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) on child
   labour and ed-ucational outcomes. We first develop a simple theoretical
   model where we explore how government transfers financed by labour
   income taxation affect household decisions on child labour and
   education. We then empirically examine the impact of Pakistan's Benazir
   Income Support Programme (BISP), which is the largest cash transfer
   program in South Asia, on child labour and school outcomes. We employ a
   regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the average effect of
   the UCTs on child labour and school outcomes, and find that UCTs have a
   positive and statistically significant impact on school enrolment and
   grade promotion, but no impact on school dropout rates in the short run.
   The BISP policy intervention increases grade promotion amongst boys but
   not amongst girls. In the short run, the BISP substantially reduces
   dropout for boys but increases substantially for girls. With regards to
   child labour, we find that the BISP policy intervention has no impact on
   child labour in the short run; but in the medium to long run, cash
   transfers help to reduce child labour amongst boys as well as girls. In
   the short run, however, the BISP in-creases child labour amongst girls
   but not boys. These findings are largely consistent with our theoretical
   predictions and also robust to a series of robustness and sensitivity
   checks.

Abstract = {{Despite increasing global attention and commitments by countries to end
   the harmful practice of child marriage, each year some 15 million girls
   marry before the age of 18. The preponderance of the evidence produced
   historically on child marriage comes from South Asia, where the vast
   majority of child brides live. Far less attention has been paid to child
   marriage in sub-Saharan Africa, where prevalence rates remain high. The
   International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) recently conducted
   research in Kenya, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia to contribute to greater
   understanding of the drivers of child marriage in each of these
   contexts. Synthesizing findings from 4 diverse countries provides a
   useful opportunity to identify similarities and differences, as well as
   understandings that may be applicable to and helpful for preventing
   child marriage across these and other settings.
   Across the 4 countries, ICRW's research echoes the existing literature
   base in affirming that child marriage is rooted in inequitable gender
   norms that prioritize women's roles as wives, mothers, and household
   caretakers, resulting in inadequate investments by families in girls'
   education. These discriminatory norms interact closely with poverty and
   a lack of employment opportunities for girls and young women to
   perpetuate marriage as a seemingly viable alternative for girls. We
   found in the African study sites that sexual relations, unplanned
   pregnancy, and school dropout often precede child marriage, which
   differs from much of the existing evidence on child marriage from South
   Asia. Further, unlike in South Asia, where family members typically
   determine the spouse a girl will marry, most girls in the Africa study
   settings have greater autonomy in partner choice selection. In Senegal,
   increasing educational attainment and labor migration, particularly by
   young women, has contributed to reduced rates of child marriage for
   girls.
   Our findings suggest that improving gender equitable norms and providing
   more-and more equitable-opportunities for girls, particularly with
   regard to education and employment, are likely to improve child marriage
   outcomes. Providing comprehensive sexuality education and youth-friendly
   reproductive health services can reduce rates of early pregnancy that
   contribute to child marriage. Finally, identifying ways in which to
   improve communication between parents and adolescent daughters could go
   far in ensuring that girls feel valued and that parents feel heard as
   they make decisions together regarding the lives and opportunities of
   these adolescent girls.}},

Title = {{``Everybody Grieves, but Still Nobody Sees{''}: Toward a Praxis of
   Recognition for Latina/o Students in U.S. Schools}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},

Abstract = {{Background/Context: The academic success and failure of low-income
   youth, and Black and Latina/o youth in particular, has received
   significant attention in the educational literature, particularly in
   relation to school dropout. Over the last decade, several studies have
   demonstrated that student-teacher relationships, committed teachers, and
   notions of caring are critical to the success of Latina/o youth.
   However, high-poverty urban schools are graduating fewer than half of
   their students, in comparison with about 70\% at the national level.
   There remains a scant body of research, policy, and conceptual
   frameworks to help address the crisis, popularly deemed the ``dropout
   crisis,{''} particularly among Latinas/os, the youngest, fastest
   growing, and lowest educated group in the United States.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: In what ways can and
   should researchers, practitioners, and policy makers recognize the
   existence of Latina/o youth? The purpose of the article, contextualized
   in the theoretical and empirical literature, is to problematize the
   concept of recognition, particularly for Latina/o youth, and introduce a
   conceptual framework to understand, examine, and help rectify the crisis
   facing this population.
   Research Design: In this conceptual paper, I argue that key stakeholders
   must recognize the existence of the Latina/o youth by acknowledging
   their human existence through legitimizing the unequal conditions and
   struggles they face in school. Educators much engage youth in curricular
   and pedagogical experiences that seek to raise students' consciousness
   through critical thinking and dialogue. This article is focused on the
   human and interpersonal actions and processes that are necessary to
   facilitate agency and change among students. Theoretical origins
   informing recognition are discussed, followed by a contextualized
   analysis of recognition within the present-day conditions of U.S.
   schools, particularly for Latina/o youth. I then propose five pedagogies
   of recognition: relational recognition, curricular recognition,
   pedagogical recognition, contextualizing recognition, and transformative
   recognition. Each form of recognition is situated in the relevant
   literature.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This article argues that the proposed
   pedagogies of recognition need to be enacted to foster the intellectual,
   academic, and political development of youth, particularly Latina/o
   youth. Recognition can help educators and scholars understand how the
   social, political, and economic conditions impact Latina/o youth and
   helps educators reframe the conceptual bases of their work by
   challenging them to interrogate the (in) effectiveness of institutional
   and classroom-level practices. The ultimate goal is to help educators
   and researchers reconstruct and redefine the purpose of education for
   Latina/o youth in U.S. schools.}},

Title = {{Teenage pregnancy rates and associations with other health risk
   behaviours: a three-wave cross-sectional study among South African
   school-going adolescents}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Teenage pregnancy still remains high in low and
   middle-income countries (LMIC), as well as in high-income countries
   (HIC). It is a major contributor to maternal and child morbidity and
   mortality rates. Furthermore, it has social consequences, such as
   perpetuating the cycle of poverty including early school dropout by the
   pregnant adolescent, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Few studies
   in SSA have investigated the trends in teenage pregnancy and the
   associated factors, while this is critical in fully understanding
   teenage pregnancy and for promotion of reproductive health among
   adolescents at large in SSA.
   Methods: To examine the trends in teenage pregnancy and to identify
   associations with other health risk behaviours in South Africa (SA), a
   total of 31 816 South African school-going adolescents between 11 to 19
   years of age were interviewed in three cross-sectional surveys. Data
   from the first (2002, n = 10 549), second (2008, n = 10 270) and the
   third (2011, n = 10 997) nationally representative South African youth
   risk behaviour surveys (YRBS) were used for this study.
   Results: The overall prevalence of having ever been pregnant among the
   combined 3-survey sample was self-reported to be 11.0 \% and stable
   across the three surveys. Sexual intercourse among adolescents in SA has
   decreased from 41.9 \% in 2002 to 36.9 \% in 2011. However, pregnancy
   among girls who ever had sex increased from 17.3 \% (95 \% CI:
   0.16-0.19) in 2002, to 23.6 \% (95 \% CI: 0.21-0.26) in 2008 and
   decreased to 21.3 \% (95 \% CI: 0.19-0.23) in 2011. The odds for ever
   been pregnant were higher for girls who had 2 or more sexual partners
   (OR: 1.250, 95 \% CI: 1.039-1.503), girls who ever used alcohol before
   sex (OR: 1.373, 95 \% CI: 1.004-1.878), practised binge-drinking during
   the last month (OR: 0.624, 95 \% CI: 0.503-0.774), and girls who used
   mandrax (OR: 1.968, 95 \% CI: 1,243-3.117). The odds for never been
   pregnant were lower for those who used condoms (OR: 0.462, 95 \% CI:
   0.309-0.691).
   Conclusions: Girls continue to become pregnant at unacceptably high
   rates in SA. Sexual intercourse among adolescents in SA has decreased
   slightly. However, among those who are sexually active pregnancy
   prevalence rates have increased. More over, this is in the context of
   high prevalence of HIV and other STI. There is a need to address
   adolescents' sexual and reproductive health, and several health risk
   behaviours, including substance use, that are associated with teenage
   pregnancy in SA.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores how employment affects the likelihood of dropout
   among high school students in Baltimore, a high-poverty city with a high
   dropout rate. Among 15-year-olds, those with teen jobs (e.g., lawn
   mowing, babysitting, etc.) were less than one third as likely to drop
   out as those who took adult-type jobs (manufacturing or business). This
   pattern reversed at age I, however because, at that age, holding an
   adult-type job as compared to a teen job reduced dropout risk. Patterns
   of work, for those older than ages 15 and 16, also affected dropout
   risk. Students who had been retained, but who made an orderly transition
   into work, were less likely to drop out than retained students who made
   a disorderly transition.}},

Abstract = {{Academic, behavioral, and social success in school strongly promotes
   positive developmental outcomes (Pettit, 2011). Unfortunately, many
   students have are at risk for developing significant social, behavioral,
   and/or emotional problems, to which schools are often inadequately
   prepared to effectively respond and intervene. Students with poor social
   and behavioral functioning are at significant risk for continued
   behavioral challenges, low academic achievement, school dropout, and
   compromised economic outcomes (Bradshaw, 2008). This pattern is no more
   evident than with minority students and those from impoverished
   neighborhoods and/or low income households, as these students are at the
   greatest risk of experiencing social-emotional and academic problems
   that negatively impact their long-term development (Guyer et al., 2009).
   Although much is known about successful classroom management strategies,
   many teachers report inadequate training in effective methods for
   helping students with social, emotional, and behavioral problems in the
   classroom (Reinke et al., 2011). This gap in teacher training is
   particularly concerning given that teachers report 16-30\% of students
   in their classrooms pose ongoing problems in terms of social, emotional,
   and behavioral difficulties (Raver \& Knitzer, 2002). When teachers
   spend a significant amount of time ineffectively dealing with
   challenging classroom behaviors, their ability to deliver quality
   academic instruction is compromised. High levels of disruptive behavior
   in the classroom negatively impact teacher job satisfaction
   (Clunies-Ross et al., 2008), while increasing stress (Greene et al.,
   2002) and the likelihood of burnout (Fernet et al., 2011).
   Under-performing schools in high-poverty areas have the highest rates of
   teacher turnover and attrition (Simon, 2013), and this educational
   instability often leads to poorer student performance (Terry \&
   Kritsonis, 2008). However, high teacher turnover in urban schools can be
   reduced through appropriate teacher training and professional
   development programs that address the area teachers find most
   challenging: managing student behavior. Providing teachers with high
   quality training in behavior management skills can result in
   wide-ranging positive effects, including fewer disciplinary and special
   education referrals, increased student academic achievement, and an
   enhanced school climate of respect (Polirstok \& Gottlieb, 2006).
   The proposed presentation will describe findings from our Promoting
   Healthy Development through Effective Practices program that focuses on
   promoting social, emotional, and behavioral skills among students as
   well as improving the classroom environment by synergistically targeting
   interventions toward second grade students and their teachers. Analyses
   included pre- and post-intervention results for standardized measures of
   child behavior and social skills. Participants included 103 total
   students (44 male, 59 female) from three public elementary schools in a
   large urban city in the United States. Results indicate that students'
   social competence and classroom behaviors significantly improved over
   time. Teachers strongly agreed that the intervention was effective and
   feasible for classroom-wide use. Audience members will learn about
   collaborating with teachers in the delivery of socio-emotional learning
   programs and implications for further practice, policy, and evaluation
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Educational attainment is the leading social determinant of
   health, but few studies of prevention programs have examined whether the
   programs are associated with educational attainment outcomes after the
   mid-20s, especially for large-scale programs that provide a longer
   duration of services.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between a preschool to third grade
   intervention and educational attainment at midlife and differences by
   program duration, sex, and parental educational level.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This matched-group, alternative
   intervention study assessed 1539 low-income minority children born in
   1979 or 1980 who grew up in high-poverty neighborhoods in Chicago,
   Illinois. The comparison group included 550 children primarily from
   randomly selected schools participating in the usual early intervention.
   A total of 989 children who entered preschool in 1983 or 1984 and
   completed kindergarten in 1986 were included in the Chicago Longitudinal
   Study and were followed up for 27 to 30 years after the end of a
   multicomponent intervention. A total of 1398 participants (90.8\%) in
   the original sample had educational attainment records at 35 years of
   age. The study was performed from January 1, 2002, through May 31, 2015.
   INTERVENTIONS The Child-Parent Center Program provides school-based
   educational enrichment and comprehensive family services from preschool
   to third grade (ages 3-9 years).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Educational outcomes from administrative
   records and self-report included school dropout, 4-year high school
   graduation, years of education, postsecondary credential, and earned
   degrees from associates to masters or higher.
   RESULTS A total of 1539 participants (mean {[}SD] age, 35.1 {[}0.32]
   years; 1423 {[}92.9\%] black and 108 {[}7.1\%] Hispanic) were included
   in the study. After weighting on 2 propensity scores, preschool
   participants had higher rates of postsecondary degree completion,
   including associates degree or higher (15.7\% vs 10.7\%; difference,
   5.0\%; 95\% CI, 1.0\%-9.0\%), masters degree (4.2\% vs 1.5\%;
   difference, 2.7\%; 95\% CI, 1.3\%-4.1\%), and years of education (12.81
   vs 12.32; difference, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.77). Duration of
   participation showed a consistent linear association with outcomes.
   Compared with fewer years, preschool to second or third grade
   participation led to higher rates of associates degree or higher (18.5\%
   vs 12.5\%; difference, 6.0\%; 95\% CI, 1.0\%-11.0\%), bachelors degree
   (14.3\% vs 8.2\%; difference, 6.1\%; 95\% CI, 1.3\%-10.9\%), and masters
   degree or higher (5.9\% vs 2.3\%; difference, 3.6\%; 95\% CI,
   1.4\%-5.9\%). The pattern of benefits was robust and favored male
   participants for high school graduation, female participants for college
   attainment, and those from lower-educated households.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study indicates that an established early
   and continuing intervention is associated with higher midlife
   postsecondary attainment. Replication and extension of findings to other
   locations and populations should further strengthen confidence in the
   health benefits of large-scale preventive interventions.}},

Title = {{A systematic review of the status of children's school access in low-
   and middle-income countries between 1998 and 2013: using the INDEPTH
   Network platform to fill the research gaps}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The framework for expanding children's school access in
   low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been directed by universal
   education policies as part of Education for All since 1990. In measuring
   progress to universal education, a narrow conceptualisation of access
   which dichotomises children's participation as being in or out of school
   has often been assumed. Yet, the actual promise of universal education
   goes beyond this simple definition to include retention, progression,
   completion, and learning.
   Objective: Our first objective was to identify gaps in the literature on
   children's school access using the zones of exclusion of the Consortium
   for Research on Educational Access, Transition, and Equity as a
   framework. Second, we gave consideration to how these gaps can be met by
   using longitudinal and cross-country data from Health and Demographic
   Surveillance System (HDSS) sites within the International Network for
   the Demographic Evaluation of Population and Their Health (INDEPTH) in
   LMICs.
   Design: Using Web of Science, we conducted a literature search of
   studies published in international peer-reviewed journals between 1998
   and 2013 in LMICs. The phrases we searched included six school outcomes:
   school enrolment, school attendance, grade progression, school dropout,
   primary to secondary school transition, and school completion. From our
   search, we recorded studies according to: 1) school outcomes; 2) whether
   longitudinal data were used; and 3) whether data from more than one
   country were analysed.
   Results: The area of school access most published is enrolment followed
   by attendance and dropout. Primary to secondary school transition and
   grade progression had the least number of publications. Of 132
   publications which we found to be relevant to school access, 33 made use
   of longitudinal data and 17 performed cross-country analyses.
   Conclusions: The majority of studies published in international
   peer-reviewed journals on children's school access between 1998 and 2013
   were focused on three outcomes: enrolment, attendance, and dropout. Few
   of these studies used data collected over time or data collected from
   more than one country for comparative analyses. The contribution of the
   INDEPTH Network in helping to address these gaps in the literature lies
   in the longitudinal design of HDSS surveys and in the diversity of
   countries within the network.}},

Abstract = {{The teen birth rate in the United States is one of the highest in the
   post-industrialized world. International comparisons suggest that U.S.
   rates reflect high levels of social disadvantage and misguided policies
   that frame teen parenting as costly for mothers, children, and
   taxpayers. Studies that control for background factors that predispose
   teens to become parents highlight the social inequities that contribute
   to early childbearing and unfavorable maternal-child outcomes,
   regardless of maternal age. After reviewing these studies, federal
   policies that target and scrutinize teenage and single mothers are
   described and critiqued for the ways they disregard the social
   determinants of early childbearing and further the marginalization and
   social exclusion of low-income families. This review calls for public
   health nurses to challenge the ideological assumptions driving
   downstream policies and to advocate for comprehensive reforms that
   reduce the wide and growing inequities in education, income, and health
   among U.S. citizens. Building the public support and political will to
   move upstream will remain daunting in light of the pervasive stereotypes
   of teen parents and the ideological assumptions that early childbearing
   and poor maternal-child outcomes stem more from individual choices and
   lifestyles than from social inequities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Adolescent girls' risk of school dropout and reproductive
   health (RH) challenges may be exacerbated by girls' attitudes toward
   their bodies and inability to manage their menstruation. We assessed
   effects of sanitary pad distribution and RH education on girls in
   primary grade 7 in Kilifi, Kenya.
   Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial design was used. Eligible
   clusters were all non-boarding schools in three sub-counties in Kilifi
   County that had a minimum of 25 girls enrolled in primary grade 7. 140
   primary schools, 35 per arm, were randomly assigned to one of four study
   arms: (1) control; (2) sanitary pad distribution; (3) RH education; or
   (4) both sanitary pad distribution and RH education. Outcomes were
   school attendance, school engagement, RH knowledge and attitudes, gender
   norms, and self-efficacy. For outcomes measured both at baseline and
   endline, difference-in-differences (DID) models were estimated and for
   outcomes without baseline data available, analysis of covariance models
   were used.
   Results: The study enrolled 3489 randomly selected girls in primary
   grade 7, with a mean age of 14.4 (SD 1.5). Girls in arms 2 and 4
   received on average 17.6 out of 20 packets of sanitary pads and girls in
   arms 3 and 4 participated on average in 21 out of 25 RH sessions.
   Ninety-four percent of the baseline sample was interviewed at the end of
   the intervention with no differential attrition by arm. There was no
   evidence of an effect on primary school attendance on arm 2 (coefficient
   {[}coef] 0.37, 95\% CI - 0.73, 1.46), arm 3 (coef 0.14, 95\% CI - 0.99,
   1.26) or arm 4 (coef 0.58, 95\% CI - .37, 1.52). There was increased
   positive RH attitudes for girls in arm 3 (DID coef. 0.63, 95\% CI
   0.40-0.86) and arm 4 (DID coef. 0.85, 95\% CI 0.64, - 1.07). There was
   also an increase in RH knowledge, gender norms and self-efficacy in arms
   3 and 4.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that neither sanitary pad distribution
   nor RH education, on their own or together, were sufficient to improve
   primary school attendance. However, as the RH education intervention
   improved RH outcomes, the evidence suggests that sanitary pad
   distribution and RH education can be positioned in broader RH
   programming for girls.

   Plain language summary
   Adolescent girls face a range of challenges that may compromise their
   chances of completing school or their sexual and reproductive health.
   These challenges can be even further complicated by girls' feelings of
   shame about their bodies, in particular about menstruation, or their
   lack of sanitary products to help them manage menstruation. This study
   sought out to assess if providing girls in grade 7 in a rural, coastal
   area of Kenya with sanitary pads and sex education would alleviate some
   of those challenges. One hundred and forty schools were included in the
   study and 35 each were randomly assigned to one of the following program
   packages: (1) standard government provision of pads and health
   education; (2) regular monthly provision of sanitary pads; (3) sex
   education; or (4) both regular monthly provision of sanitary pads and
   sex education. The study found that none of the three program packages
   had an impact on school attendance, however those that participated in
   the sex education felt more positively about menstruation, knew more
   about sexual and reproductive health, had more equitable gender norms
   and were more self-confident at the end of the program. The study
   results show that addressing girls' menstrual health challenges are
   important, but are better positioned as part of comprehensive sexuality
   education programs addressing stigma and shame associated with
   menstruation, access to menstrual products, inequitable gender norms and
   sexual and reproductive health knowledge gaps, as opposed to a girls
   education intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated pathways that might explain the observed
   linkage between participation in early intervention programs and later
   educational attainment using a sample from the Chicago Longitudinal
   Study, an on-going investigation of low-income minority children growing
   up in high-poverty neighborhoods in Chicago. A review of literature on
   pathways of early intervention programs on educational attainment was
   provided. Five mechanisms derived from previous studies, i.e., cognitive
   advantage, family support, social adjustment, motivational advantage,
   and school support, were investigated as predictors of educational
   attainment at age 22 years. LISREL analyses revealed that the relation
   between participation in the Chicago Child-Parent Center (CPC) program
   in early childhood and subsequent educational attainment was best
   predicted by cognitive advantage effects, followed by family support and
   school support effects. The findings indicated that environmental
   factors, such as family and school, as well as personal characteristics
   that may be affected by the intervention, play important roles in
   predicting educational outcomes. The discussion focuses on how
   environmental factors such as promoting family-school partnerships and
   attention to family influences in early intervention programs might
   maintain and enhance the effects of early intervention so as to promote
   higher educational attainment much later in development. (c) 2005

Title = {{The Young Women's Health CoOp in Cape Town, South Africa: Study protocol
   for a cluster-randomised trial for adolescent women at risk for HIV}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: South Africa remains the global epicentre of HIV infection,
   and adolescent women have the highest incidence of HIV in the country.
   South Africa also has high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use,
   violence, and gender inequality. Violence converges with AOD use, gender
   inequities and other disparities, such as poverty, to increase sexual
   risk and poor educational attainment for adolescent women. This study
   seeks to test the efficacy of peer recruitment and cofacilitation of the
   Young Women's Health CoOp (YWHC), a comprehensive gender-focused
   intervention to reduce HIV risk behaviours and increase the uptake of
   HIV counselling and testing (HCT) among out-of-school, adolescent women
   who use AODs. The YWHC is facilitated by local research staff and
   supported by peers.
   Methods: This cluster-randomised trial is enrolling participants into
   two arms: a control arm that receives standard HCT, and an intervention
   arm that receives the YWHC. Participants are enrolled from 24
   economically disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa. These
   geographically distinct communities serve as clusters that are the units
   of randomisation. This study uses adolescent peer role models and
   research field staff to recruit marginalised adolescent women. At
   baseline, participants complete a questionnaire and biological testing
   for HIV, recent AOD use, and pregnancy. The core intervention is
   delivered in the month following enrollment, with linkages to health
   services and educational programmes available to participants throughout
   the follow-up period. Follow-up interviews and biological testing are
   conducted at 6 and 12 months post enrollment.
   Discussion: The study findings will increase knowledge of the efficacy
   of a comprehensive HCT, gender-focused programme in reducing AOD use,
   victimisation, and sexual risk behaviour and increase uptake services
   for out-of-school, adolescent women who use AODs. The trial results
   could lead to wider implementation of the YWHC for vulnerable adolescent
   women, a key population often neglected in health services.}},
